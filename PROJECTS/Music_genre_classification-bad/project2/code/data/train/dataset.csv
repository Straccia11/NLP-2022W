on the estate the monkeys listen quietly the flamingoes flutter then there is a burst of loud music from the stereo speakers on the balcony a billy joel song something smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they go and we see tony in long shot throw open the terrace doors and stagger out onto the balcony overlooking his estate on a closer angle we track him to the edge of the balustrade he is done so much coke now he is practically catatonic staggering and muttering to himself tony insensate jesus fuckin christ whatsa matter with me get a hold of yself now these cocksuckers going to run over you let them try i bury the cocksuckers his point of view panning his estate the dark emptiness echoes back at him the wind rustling the treetops tony shaking his head at himself he starts to cry tony ooooh fuck manny how the fuck did i do that how the fuck oh manny manny you were there for me you were the one manny you understood always understood well what the hell happened hunh what the hell happened to us in far background now behind tony on the video monitors in his office we see the main gate and guard shack a marielito crosses into view checks the gate turns suddenly two figures spring out at him one of them garrotting the marielito he struggles another monitor now reveals two more figures moving into the interior of the guard shack they knife the other marielito a third monitor carries another image of shadows moving through the trees on the estate on the balcony tony is oblivious to it all spent almost incoherent tony i said to you manny i said i never go crazy and you said i would you sonofabitch and you was right those were the good days hunh we was crazy back in those days we would do anything you and me we was on the way up nobody nothing coulda stopped us because we were the best hunh the fucking best as tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade a shadow starts climbing up as tony we still are manny we still are see i am going to wipe out all them fuckers out there i am going to run the market i am going to be king cocaine you hear me you buy you buy from me tony montana covers of all the magazines fan mail television stars movie stars shooting stars he is a star int tonys mansion office as he crosses into his office the camera moves to reveal gina standing there halfdressed in the doorway her eyes blazing with hatred tony sees her she steps forward offering her body almost naked to her brother gina is this what you want tony tony shocked gina you cannot stand another man touching me so you want me tony is that it well here i am she fires the baretta we now see in her hand the bullet grazes tony in the leg snapping him from his catatonia as he goes reeling across the floor behind his desk she fires again again gina i am all yours tony i am all yours now bullets ripping into the desk she advances offering her sex methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals gina come and get me tony before it is too late he spins across the run away from the desk trying to put distance between them she sees him scurrying turns an expression like a demented angel gina come on tony fuck me fuck me fuck me advancing on him firing the furniture tearing up the chair spilling television sets and computer toys shattering tony squirming away hit again in the thigh shocked scrambling over to the terrace windows her next shot shatters the window and as tony ducks again to the side we see outside onto the terrace behind him a young columbian punk no more than twenty one of the hitters is crouched there reacting to the broken window he does not hesitate turning his machine gun on gina gina is torn to pieces by the firepower blown across the room spine severed and dead before she hits the floor tony sees it yells something in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside the punk is taken by surprise not having seen tony and tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade the punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds at the base of the balcony tony from above grabs up the punks machine gun and empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below ernie runs into view on the far side of the pool spots tony yells up ernie get outta here tony they are everywhere ernie suddenly wheels hit in the face by a burst of silencer bullets we catch a brief glimpse of sosas black aide the skull moving quickly along the wall of the house directly underneath the balcony on which tony stands tony tossing the empty machine gun aside wildly runs back into his office to get more guns crosses to gina corpse it takes him by surprise he comes to a dead stop kneels looking questioningly in her face tony gently hey gina come on you still angry at me i did not mean to kill manny i was i was running his hands along her face trying to rouse her gently lifting her eyelids bloods running out of her mouth in rivers tony tx come on gina get off the floor you are all dirty now you need a bath mamis going to be angry baby ooh is she going to be mad at me come on open your eyes my baby open your eyes give me a smile there is been a steady pounding and calling now on the door of the office tony finally hears it looks up then over at the monitors one of them reveals chichi standing there outside the door pounding it chichi boss hey boss open up on the monitor we see chichi suddenly spin and open fire down into the foyer return fire decimates him a grenade goes off blows him up against the door tony cheeee he now seems to come out of his catatonia runs to his sideboard hauls out a rocket shoulderfired rocket launcher and straps an uzi across his shoulder he looks up at the monitor on the monitors the hitters are now darting across the foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs three of them are already huddled outside the door around the corpse of chichi motioning toeach other laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out tony loading his rocket intends to beat them to the punch talking to himself tony so you want to play hunh say hello to my little friend here karroooomph the rocket tears down the door and blows the columbian punks off the landing into the foyer it sounds like armageddon one of the hitters screaming smoke billowing wildly tony at the height of his mad glory steps out at the apex of the stairs firing his machine gun and yelling tony whores cowards you think you can kill me with lousy bullets hunh another hitter tumbles down the righthand stair tony who you think i am i kill all you fuckin assholes i take you all to fuckin hell another hitter drops screaming off the stairs into the pool below a grenade goes off tony is hit again but keeps on firing away laughing like a madman tony you need an army you hear an army to kill me behind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go up in a burst of wind whipping around the office in auras of white it is a ghostly effect out of which now appears the face of the skull moving from the terrace towards tonys back with a sawedoff shotgun tony ha ha ha ha ha you whores you scum i piss in your faces ha ha ha ha ha the skull now inches from tonys back pulls the trigger and blows tonys spine out his belly tony crashes forward over the banister into the interior swimming pool below he floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters as the titles begin their crawl up the music theme is expressive salsa with a dash of gaiety the camera moving off tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters it says the world is yours and so for the brief moment it was our camera now distancing itself from the body in the pool panning past the dream villa past the shambles and the wealth past the hitters pillaging and looting and drawing that obscene word chivato in blood on the outside walls past the stacks of cash blowing across the floor like leaves in autumn with the looters running after it across the busted door with the tropic wind blowing down coconut grove to the miami skyline across biscayne bay the endembed

rock,chapter two a visit from albertine prospect of rich brides for certain friends of saintloup the wit of the guermantes as displayed before the princesse de parme a strange visit to m de charlus his character puzzles me more and more the red shoes of the duchess albeit it was simply a sunday in autumn i had been born again life lay intact before me for that morning after a succession of mild days there had been a cold mist which had not cleared until nearly midday a change in the weather is sufficient to create the world and oneself anew formerly when the wind howled in my chimney i would listen to the blows which it struck on the iron trap with as keen an emotion as if like the famous bowtaps with which the c minor symphony opens they had been the irresistible appeal of a mysterious destiny every change in the aspect of nature offers us a similar transformation by adapting our desires so as to harmonise with the new form of things the mist from the moment of my awakening had made of me instead of the centrifugal being which one is on fine days a selfcentred man longing for the chimney corner and the nuptial couch a shivering adam in quest of a sedentary eve in this different world between the soft grey tint of a morning landscape and the taste of a cup of chocolate i tried to account for all the originality of the physical intellectual and moral life which i had taken with me about a year earlier to doncieres and which blazoned with the oblong form of a bare hillside always present even when it was invisible formed in me a series of pleasures entirely distinct from all others incommunicable to my friends in the sense that the impressions richly interwoven with one another which gave them their orchestral accompaniment were a great deal more characteristic of them to my subconscious mind than any facts that i might have related from this point of view the new world in which the mist of this morning had immersed me was a world already known to me which only made it more real and forgotten for some time which restored all its novelty and i was able to look at several of the pictures of misty landscapes which my memory had acquired notably a series of mornings at doncieres including my first morning there in barracks and another in a neighbouring country house where i had gone with saintloup to spend the night in which from the windows whose curtains i had drawn back at daybreak before getting into bed again in the first a trooper in the second on the thin margin of a pond and a wood all the rest of which was engulfed in the uniform and liquid softness of the mist a coachman busy polishing a strap had appeared to me like those rare figures scarcely visible to the eye obliged to adapt itself to the mysterious vagueness of their halflights which emerge from an obliterated fresco it was from my bed that i was looking this afternoon at these pictorial memories for i had gone back to bed to wait until the hour came at which taking advantage of the absence of my parents who had gone for a few days to combray i proposed to get up and go to a little play which was being given that evening in mme de villeparisiss drawingroom had they been at home i should perhaps not have ventured to go out my mother in the delicacy of her respect for my grandmothers memory wished the tokens of regret that were paid to it to be freely and sincerely given she would not have forbidden me this outing she would have disapproved of it from combray on the other hand had i consulted her wishes she would not have replied in a melancholy do just as you like you are old enough now to know what is right or wrong but reproaching herself for having left me alone in paris and measuring my grief by her own would have wished for it distractions of a sort which she would have refused to herself and which she persuaded herself that my grandmother solicitous above all things for my health and the preservation of my nervous balance would have advised me to take that morning the furnace of the new steam heater had for the first time been lighted its disagreeable sound an intermittent hiccough had no part whatsoever in my memories of doncieres but its prolonged encounter in me this afternoon with them was to give it so lasting an affinity with them that whenever after succeeding more or less in forgetting it i heard the central heater hiccough again it reminded me of them there was no one else in the house but françoise the grey light falling like a fine rain on the earth wove without ceasing a transparent web through which the sunday holidaymakers appeared in a silvery sheen i had flung to the foot of my bed the figaro for which i had been sending out religiously every morning ever since i had sent in an article which it had not yet printed despite the absence of the sun the intensity of the daylight was an indication that we were still only halfway through the afternoon the tulle windowcurtains vaporous and friable as they would not have been on a fine day had that same blend of beauty and fragility that dragon flies wings have and venetian glass it depressed me all the more that i should be spending this sunday by myself because i had sent a note that morning to mlle de stermaria robert de saintloup whom his mother had at length succeeded in parting after painful and abortive attempts from his mistress and who immediately afterwards had been sent to morocco in the hope of his there forgetting one whom he had already for some little time ceased to love had sent me a line which had reached me the day before announcing his arrival presently in france for a short spell of leave as he would only be passing through paris where his family were doubtless afraid of seeing him renew relations with rachel he informed me to shew me that he had been thinking of me that he had met at tangier mile or rather mme for she had divorced her husband three months after their marriage de stermaria and robert remembering what i had told him at balbec had asked her on my behalf to arrange a meeting she would be delighted to dine with me she had told him on one of the evenings which before her return to brittany she would be spending in paris he warned me to lose no time in writing to mme de stermaria for she would certainly have arrived before i got his letter this had corne as no surprise to me even although i had had no news of him since at the time of my grandmothers last illness he had accused me of perfidy and treachery it had then been quite easy to see what must have happened rachel who liked to provoke his jealousy she had other reasons also for wishing me harm had persuaded her lover that i had made a dastardly attempt to have relations with her in his absence it is probable that he continued to believe in the truth of this allegation but he had ceased to be in love with her which meant that its truth or falsehood had become a matter of complete indifference to him and our friendship alone remained when on meeting him again i attempted to speak to him about his attack on me his sole answer was a cordial and friendly smile which gave him the air of begging my pardon then he turned the conversation to something else all this was not to say that he did not a little later see rachel occasionally when he was in paris the fellowcreatures who have played a leading part in ones life very rarely disappear from it suddenly with any finality they return to take their old place in it at odd moments so much so as to lead people to believe in a renewal of old love before leaving it for ever saintloups breach with rachel had very soon become less painful to him thanks to the soothing pleasure that was given him by her incessant demands for money jealousy which prolongs the course of love is not capable of containing many more ingredients than are the other forms of imagination if one takes with one when one starts on a journey three or four images which incidentally one is sure to lose on the way such as the lilies and anemones heaped on the ponte vecchio or the persian church shrouded in mist ones trunk is already pretty full when one parts from a mistress one would be just as glad until one has begun to forget her that she should not become the property of three or four potential protectors whom one has in ones minds eye of whom that is to say one is jealous all those whom one does not so picture count for nothing now frequent demands for money from a castoff mistress no more give one a complete idea of her life than charts shewing a high temperature would of her illness but the latter would at any rate be an indication that she was ill and the former furnish a presumption vague enough it is true that the forsaken one or forsaker whichever she be cannot have found anything very remarkable in the way of rich protectors and so each demand is welcomed with the joy which a lull produces in the jealous ones sufferings while he responds to it at once by dispatching money for naturally he does not like to think of her being in want of anything except lovers one of the three lovers he has in his minds eye until time has enabled him to regain his composure and he can learn without the slightest emotion the name of his successor sometimes rachel came in so late at night that she could ask her former lovers permission to lie down beside him until the morning this was a great comfort to robert for it refreshed his memory of how they had after all lived in intimacy together merely to see that even if he took the greater part of the bed for himself it did not in the least interfere with her sleep he realised that she was more comfortable lying close to his body than she would have been elsewhere that she felt herself by his side even in an hotel to be in a bedroom known of old in which the force of habit prevails and one sleeps better he felt that his shoulders his limbs all of him were for her even when he was unduly restless from sleeplessness or from having to get up in the night things so entirely usual that they could not disturb her and that the perception of them added still further to her sense of repose to revert to where we were i had been all the more disquieted by roberts letter in that i could read between the lines what he had not ventured to write more explicitly you can most certainly ask her to dine in a private room he told me she is a charming young person a delightful nature you will get on splendidly with her and i am sure you will have a capital evening together as my parents were returning at the end of the week on saturday or sunday and as after that i should be forced to dine every evening at home i had written at once to mme de stermaria proposing any evening that might suit her up to friday a message was brought back that i should hear from her in writing the same evening about eight of the clock the time would have passed quickly enough if i had had during the afternoon that separated me from her letter the help of a visit from anyone else when the hours pass wrapped in conversation one ceases to count or indeed to notice them they vanish and suddenly it is a long way beyond the point at which it escaped you that there reappears the nimble truant time but if we are alone our preoccupation by bringing before us the still distant and incessantly awaited moment with the frequency and uniformity of a ticking pendulum divides or rather multiplies the hours by all the minutes which had we been with friends we should not have counted and confronted by the incessant return of my desire with the ardent pleasure which i was going to taste not for some days though alas in mme de stermarias company this afternoon which i should have to spend by myself seemed to me very empty and very melancholy every now and then i heard the sound of the lift coming up but it was followed by a second sound not that for which i was hoping namely the sound of its coming to a halt at our landing but another very different sound which the lift made in continuing its progress to the floors above and which because it so often meant the desertion of my floor when i was expecting a visitor remained for me at other times even when i had no wish to see anyone a sound lugubrious in itself in which there echoed as it were a sentence of solitary confinement weary resigned busy for several hours still over its immemorial task the grey day stitched its shimmering needlework of light and shade and it saddened me to think that i was to be left alone with a thing that knew me no more than would a seamstress who installed by the window so as to see better while she finished her work paid no attention to the person present with her in the room suddenly although i had heard no bell françoise opened the door to let in albertine who came forward smiling silent plump containing in the fulness of her body made ready so that i might continue living them come in search of me the days we had spent together at that balbec to which i had never since returned no doubt whenever we see again a person with whom our relations however trivial they may have been are altered it is like a juxtaposition of two different periods for this we do not require that a former mistress should come to call upon us as a friend all that we need is the visit to paris of a person whom we had known in the daily round of some particular kind of life and that this life should have ceased for us were it no more than a week ago on each of albertines smiling questioning blushing features i could read the questions and madame de villeparisis and the dancingmaster and the pastrycook when she sat down her back seemed to be saying gracious there is no cliff here you do not mind if i sit down beside you all the same as i used to do at balbec she was like an enchantress handing me a mirror that reflected time in this she was like all the people whom we seldom see now but with whom at one time we lived on more intimate terms with albertine however there was something more than this certainly even at balbec in our daily encounters i had always been surprised when she came in sight so variable was her appearance from day to day but now it was difficult to recognise her cleared of the pink vapour that used to bathe them her features had emerged like those of a statue she had another face or rather she had a face at last her body too had grown there remained scarcely anything now of the she will in which she had been enclosed and on the surface of which at balbec her future outline had been barely visible this time albertine had returned to paris earlier than usual as a rule she came only in the spring which meant that already disturbed for some weeks past by the storms that were beating down the first flowers i did not distinguish in the elements of the pleasure that i felt the return of albertine from that of the fine weather it was enough that i should be told that she was in paris and that she had called at the house for me to see her again like a rose flowering by the sea i cannot say whether it was the desire for balbec or for herself that overcame me at such moments possibly my desire for her was itself a lazy cowardly and incomplete method of possessing balbec as if to possess a thing materially to take up ones abode in a town were equivalent to possessing it spiritually besides even materially when she was no longer posed by my imagination before a horizon of sea but sitting still in a room with me she seemed to me often a very poor specimen of a rose so poor indeed that i would gladly have shut my eyes in order not to observe this or that blemish of its petals and to imagine instead that i was inhaling the salt air on the beach i must say it at this point albeit i was not then aware of what was to happen only later on certainly it is more reasonable to devote ones life to women than to postage stamps or old snuffboxes even to pictures or statues only the example of other collectors should be a warning to us to make changes to have not one woman only but several those charming suggestions in which a girl abounds of a seabeach of the braided hair of a statue in church of an old print of everything that makes one see and admire in her whenever she appears a charming composition those suggestions are not very stable live with a woman altogether and you will soon cease to see any of the things that made you love her though i must add that these two sundered elements can be reunited by jealousy if after a long period of life in common i was to end by seeing nothing more in albertine than an ordinary woman an intrigue between her and some person whom she had loved at balbec would still suffice perhaps to reincorporate in her to amalgamate the beach and the unrolling of the tide only as these secondary suggestions no longer captivate our eyes it is to the heart that they are perceptible and fatal we cannot under so dangerous a form regard the repetition of the miracle as a thing to be desired but i am anticipating the course of years and here i need only state my regret that i did not have the sense simply to have kept my collection of women as people keep their collections of old quizzing glasses never so complete in their cabinet that there is not room always for another and rarer still departing from the customary order of her holiday movements this year she had come straight from balbec where furthermore she had not stayed nearly so late as usual it was a long time since i had seen her and as i did not know even by name the people with whom she was in the habit of mixing in paris i could form no impression of her during the periods in which she abstained from coming to see me these lasted often for quite a time then one fine day in would burst albertine whose rosy apparitions and silent visits left me little if any better informed as to what she might have been doing in an interval which remained plunged in that darkness of her hidden life which my eyes felt little anxiety to pierce this time however certain signs seemed to indicate that some new experience must have entered into that life and yet perhaps all that one was entitled to conclude from them was that girls change very rapidly at the age which albertine had now reached for instance her intellect was now more in evidence and on my reminding her of the day when she had insisted with so much ardour on the superiority of her idea of making sophocles write my dear racine she was the first to laugh quite wholeheartedly at her own stupidity andrée was quite right it was stupid of me she admitted sophocles ought to have begun sir i replied that the sir and dear sir of andrée were no less comic than her own my dear racine or giseles my dear friend but that after all the really stupid people were the professors who still went on making sophocles write letters to racine here however albertine was unable to follow me she could not see in what the silliness consisted her intelligence was dawning but had not fully developed there were other more attractive novelties in her i felt in this same pretty girl who had just sat down by my bed something that was different and in those lines which in ones eyes and other features express ones general attitude towards life a change of front a partial conversion as though there had now been shattered those resistances against which i had hurled my strength in vain at balbec one evening now remote in time on which we formed a couple symmetrical with but the con of our present arrangement since then it had lieen she who was lying down and i who sat by her bedside wishing and not venturing to make certain whether now she would let herself be kissed every time that she rose to go i asked her to stay beside me a little longer this was a concession not very easy to obtain for albeit she had nothing to do otherwise she would have rushed from the house she was a person methodical in her habits and moreover not very gracious towards me scarcely to be at ease in my company and yet each time after looking at her watch she sat down again at my request until finally she had spent several hours with me without my having asked her for anything the things i was saying to her followed logically those that i had said during the hours before and bore no relation to what i was thinking about what i desired from her remained indefinitely parallel there is nothing like desire for preventing the thing one says from bearing any resemblance to what one has in ones mind time presses and yet it seems as though we were seeking to gain time by speaking of subjects absolutely alien to that by which we are obsessed we then arrange that the sentence which we should like to utter shall be accompanied or rather preluded by a gesture supposing that is to say that we have not to give ourselves the pleasure of an immediate demonstration and to gratify the curiosity we feel as to the reactions which will follow it without a word said without even a by your leave already made this gesture certainly i was not in the least in love with albertine child of the mists outside she could merely content the imaginative desire which the change of weather had awakened in me and which was midway between the desires that are satisfied by the arts of the kitchen and of monumental sculpture respectively for it made me dream simultaneously of mingling with my flesh a substance different and warm and of attaching at some point to my outstretched body a body divergent as the body of eve barely holds by the feet to the side of adam to whose body hers is almost perpendicular in those romanesque basreliefs on the church at balbec which represent in so noble and so reposeful a fashion still almost like a classical frieze the creation of woman god in them is everywhere followed as by two ministers by two little angels in whom the visitor recognises like winged swarming summer creatures which winter has surprised and spared cupids from herculaneum still surviving well into the thirteenth century and winging their last slow flight weary but never failing in the grace that might be expected of them over the whole front of the porch as for this pleasure which by accomplishing my desire would have set me free from these meditations and which i should have sought quite as readily from any other pretty woman had i been asked upon what in the course of this endless flow of talk throughout which i took care to keep from albertine the one thing that was in my mind was based my optimistic hypothesis with regard to her possible complaisances i should perhaps have answered that this hypothesis was due while the forgotten outlines of albertines voice retraced for me the contour of her personality to the apparition of certain words which did not form part of her vocabulary or at least not in the acceptation which she now gave them thus she said to roe that elstir was stupid and on my protesting you do not understand she replied smiling i mean that it was stupid of him to behave like that of course i know he is quite a distinguished person really similarly wishing to say of the fontainebleau golf club that it was smart she declared they are quite a selection speaking of a duel that i had fought she said of my seconds what very choice seconds and looking at my face confessed that she would like to see me wear a moustache she even went so far and my chance appeared then enormous as to announce in a phrase of which i would have sworn that she was ignorant a year earlier that since she had last seen gisele there had passed a certain lapse of time this was not to say that albertine had not already possessed when i was at balbec a quite adequate assortment of those expressions which reveal at once that ones people are in easy circumstances and which year by year a mother passes on to her daughter just as she bestows on her gradually as the girl grows up on important occasions her own jewels it was evident that albertine had ceased to be a little girl when one day to express her thanks for a present which a strange lady had given her she had said i am quite confused mme bontemps could not help looking across at her husband whose comment was gad she is old for fourteen the approach of nubility had been more strongly marked still when albertine speaking of another girl whose tone was bad said one cannot even tell whether she is pretty she paints her face a foot thick finally though still a schoolgirl she already displayed the manner of a grown woman of her upbringing and station when she said of some one whose face twitched i cannot look at him because it makes me want to do the same or if some one else were being imitated the absurd thing about it is that when you imitate her voice you look exactly like her all these are drawn from the social treasury but it did not seem to me possible that albertines natural environment could have supplied her with distinguished used in the sense in which my father would say of a colleague whom he had not actually met but whose intellectual attainments he had heard praised it appears he is quite a distinguished person selection even when used of a golf club seemed to me as incompatible with the simonet family as it would be if preceded by the adjective natural with a text published centuries before the researches of darwin lapse of time struck me as being of better augury still finally there appeared the evidence of certain upheavals the nature of which was unknown to me but sufficient to justify me in all my hopes when albertine announced with the satisfaction of a person whose opinion is by no means to be despised you might also like to my mind that is the best thing that could possibly happen i regard it as the best solution the stylish way out this was so novel so manifestly an alluvial deposit giving one to suspect such capricious wanderings over soil hitherto unknown to her that on hearing the words to my mind i drew albertine towards me and at i regard made her sit on the side of my bed no doubt it does happen that women of moderate culture on marrying wellread men receive such expressions as part of their paraphernalia and shortly after the metamorphosis which follows the wedding night when they begin to pay calls and talk shyly to the friends of their girlhood one notices with surprise that they have turned into matrons if in deciding that some person is intelligent they sound both ls in the word but that is precisely the sign of a change of state and i could see a difference when i thought of the vocabulary of the albertine i had known of old a vocabulary in which the most daring flights were to say of any unusual person he is a type or if you suggested a game of cards to her i have no money to lose or again if any of her friends were to reproach her in terms which she felt to be undeserved that really is magnificent an expression dictated in such cases by a sort of middleclass tradition almost as old as the magnificat itself and one which a girl slightly out of temper and confident that she is in the right employs as the saying is quite naturally that is to say because she has learned the words from her mother just as she has learned to say her prayers or to greet a friend all these expressions mme bontemps had imparted to her at the same time as her hatred of the jews and her feeling for black which was always suitable and becoming indeed without any formal instruction but as the piping of the parent goldfinches serves as a model for that of the young ones recently hatched so that they in turn grow into true goldfinches also but when all was said selection appeared to me of alien growth and i regard encouraging albertine was no longer the same which meant that she would not perhaps act would not react in the same way not only did i no longer feel any love for her but i had no longer to consider as i should have had at balbec the risk of shattering in her an affection for myself which no longer existed there could be no doubt that she had long since become quite indifferent to me i was well aware that to her i was in no sense a member now of the little band into which i had at one time so anxiously sought and had then been so happy to have secured admission besides as she had no longer even as in balbec days an air of frank good nature i felt no serious scruples still i believe that what made me finally decide was another philological discovery as continuing to add fresh links to the external chain of talk behind which i hid my intimate desire i spoke having albertine secure now on the corner of my bed of one of the girls of the little band one smaller than the rest whom nevertheless i had thought quite pretty yes answered albertine she reminds me of a little mousmé there had been nothing in the world to shew when i first knew albertine that she had ever heard the wordmousmé it was probable that had things followed their normal course she would never have learned it and for my part i should have seen no because for regret in that for there is no more horrible word in the language the mere sound of it makes ones teeth ache as they do when one has put too large a spoonful of ice in ones mouth but coming from albertine as she sat there looking so pretty not even mousmé could strike me as unpleasant on the contrary i felt it to be a revelation if not of an outward initiation at any rate of an inward evolution unfortunately it was now time for me to bid her goodbye if i wished her to reach home in time for her dinner and myself to be out of bed and dressed in time for my own it was françoise who was getting it ready she did not like having to keep it back and must already have found it an infringement of one of the articles of her code that albertine in the absence of my parents should be paying me so prolonged a visit and one which was going to make everything late but before mousmé all these arguments fell to the ground and i hastened to say just fancy i am not in the least ticklish you can go on tickling me for an hour on end and i will not even feel it really i assure you she understood doubtless that this was the awkward expression of a desire on my part for like a person who offers to give you an introduction for which you have not ventured to ask him though what you have said has shewn him that it would be of great service to you would you like me to try she inquired with womanly meekness just as you like but you would be more comfortable if you lay down properly on the bed like that no get right on top you are sure i am not too heavy as she uttered these words the door opened and françoise carrying a lamp came in albertine had just time to fling herself back upon her chair perhaps françoise had chosen this moment to confound us having been listening at the door or even peeping through the keyhole but there was no need to suppose anything of the sort she might have scorned to assure herself by the use of her eyes of what her instinct must plainly enough have detected for by dint of living with me and my parents her fears her prudence her alertness her cunning had ended by giving her that instinctive and almost prophetic knowledge of us all that the mariner has of the sea the quarry of the hunter and of the malady if not the physician often at any rate the patient the amount of knowledge that she managed to acquire would have astounded a stranger and with as good reason as does the advanced state of certain arts and sciences among the ancients seeing that there was practically no source of information open to them her sources were no larger they were a few casual remarks forming barely a twentieth part of our conversation at dinner caught on the wing by the butler and inaccurately transmitted to the kitchen again her mistakes were due like theirs like the fables in which plato believed rather to a false conception of the world and to preconceived ideas than to the insufficiency of the materials at her disposal only the other day has it not been possible for the most important discoveries as to the habits of insects to be made by a scientist who had access to no laboratory and used no instruments of any sort but if the drawbacks arising from her menial position had not prevented her from acquiring a stock of learning indispensable to the art which was its ultimate goal and which consisted in putting us to confusion by communicating to us the results of her discoveries the limitations under which she worked had done more in this case the impediment not content with merely not paralysing the flight of her imagination had greatly strengthened it of course françoise never let slip any artificial device those for example of diction and attitude since if she never believed what we said to her hoping that she would believe it she admitted without any shadow of doubt the truth of anything that any person of her own condition in life might tell her however absurd which might at the same time prove shocking to our ideas just as her way of listening to our assertions bore witness to her incredulity so the accents in which she reported the use of indirect speech enabling her to hurl the most deadly insults at us with impunity the narrative of a cook who had told her how she had threatened her employers and won from them by treating them before all the world like dirt any number of privileges and concessions shewed that the story was to her as gospel françoise went so far as to add i am sure if i had been the mistress i should have been quite vexed in vain might we despite our scant sympathy at first with the lady on the fourth floor shrug our shoulders as though at an unlikely fable at this report of so shocking an example in making it the teller was able to speak with the crushing the lacerating force of the most unquestionable most irritating affirmation but above all just as great writers often attain to a power of concentration from which they would have been dispensed under a system of political liberty or literary anarchy when they are bound by the tyranny of a monarch or of a school of poetry by the severity of prosodie laws or of a state religion so françoise not being able to reply to us in an explicit fashion spoke like tiresias and would have written like tacitus she managed to embody everything that she could not express directly in a sentence for which we could not find fault with her without accusing ourselves indeed in less than a sentence in a silence in the way in which she placed a thing in a room thus when i happened to leave by accident on my table among a pile of other letters one which it was imperative that she should not see because let us say it referred to her with a dislike which afforded a presumption of the same feeling towards her in the recipient as in the writer that evening if i came home with a troubled conscience and went straight to my room there on top of my letters neatly arranged in a symmetrical pile the compromising document caught my eye as it could not possibly have failed to catch the eye of françoise placed by her right at the top almost separated from the rest in a prominence that was a form of speech that had an eloquence all its own and as i stood in the doorway made me shudder like a cry she excelled in the preparation of these scenic effects intended so to enlighten the spectator in her absence that he already knew that she knew everything when in due course she made her appearance she possessed for thus making an inanimate object speak the art at once inspired and painstaking of irving or frédéric lemaître on this occasion holding over albertine and myself the lighted lamp whose searching beams missed none of the still visible depressions which the girls body had hollowed in the counterpane françoise made one think of a picture of justice throwing light upon crime albertines face did not suffer by this illumination it revealed on her cheeks the same sunny burnish that had charmed me at balbec this face of albertine the general effect of which sometimes was out of doors a sort of milky pallor now shewed according as the lamp shone on them surfaces so dazzlingly so uniformly coloured so firm so glowing that one might have compared them to the sustained flesh tints of certain flowers taken aback meanwhile by the unexpected entry of françoise i exclaimed what the lamp already i say the light is strong my object as may be imagined was by the second of these ejaculations to account for my confusion by the first to excuse my lateness in rising françoise replied with a cruel ambiguity do you want me to extinglish it guish albertine slipped into my ear leaving me charmed by the familiar vivacity with which taking me at once for teacher and for accomplice she insinuated this psychological affirmation as though asking a grammatical question when françoise had left the room and albertine was seated once again on my bed do you know what i am afraid of i asked her it is that if we go on like this i may not be able to resist the temptation to kiss you that would be a fine pity i did not respond at once to this invitation which another man might even have found superfluous for albertines way of pronouncing her words was so carnal so seductive that merely in speaking to you she seemed to be caressing you a word from her was a favour and her conversation covered you with kisses and yet it was highly attractive to me this invitation it would have been so indeed coming from any pretty girl of albertines age but that albertine should be now so accessible to me gave me more than pleasure brought before my eyes a series of images that bore the stamp of beauty i recalled the original albertine standing between me and the beach almost painted upon a background of sea having for me no more real existence than those figures seen on the stage when one knows not whether one is looking at the actress herself who is supposed to appear at an understudy who for the moment is taking her principals part or at a mere projection from a lantern then the real woman had detached herself from the luminous mass had come towards me with the sole result that i had been able to see that she had nothing in real life of that amorous facility which one supposed to be stamped upon her in the magic pictures i had learned that it was not possible to touch her to embrace her that one might only talk to her that for me she was no more a woman than the jade grapes an inedible decoration at one time in fashion on dinner tables are really fruit and now she was appearing to me in a third plane real as in the second experience that i had had of her but facile as in the first facile and all the more deliciously so in that i had so long imagined that she was not my surplus knowledge of life of a life less uniform less simple than i had at first supposed it to be inclined me provisionally towards agnosticism what can one positively affirm when the thing that one thought probable at first has then shewn itself to be false and in the third instance turns out true and alas i was not yet at the end of my discoveries with regard to albertine in any case even if there had not been the romantic attraction of this disclosure of a greater wealth of planes revealed one after another by life an attraction the opposite of that which saintloup had felt during our dinners at rivebelle on recognising beneath the mask with which the course of existence had overlaid them in a calm face features to which his lips had once been pressed the knowledge that to kiss albertines cheeks was a possible thing was a pleasure perhaps greater even than that of kissing them what a difference between possessing a woman to whom one applies ones body alone because she is no more than a piece of flesh and possessing the girl whom one used to see on the beach with her friends on certain days without even knowing why one saw her on those days and not on others which made one tremble to think that one might not see her again life had obligingly revealed to one in its whole extent the romance of this little girl had lent one for the study of her first one optical instrument then another and had added to ones carnal desire an accompaniment which multiplied it an hundredfold and diversified it with those other desires more spiritual and less easily assuaged which do not emerge from their torpor leaving carnal desire to move by itself when it aims only at the conquest of a piece of flesh but which to gain possession of a whole tract of memories whence they have felt the wretchedness of exile rise in a tempest round about it enlarge extend it are unable to follow it to the accomplishment the assimilation impossible in the form in which it is looked for of an immaterial reality but wait for this desire halfway and at the moment of recollection of return furnish it afresh with their escort to kiss instead of the cheeks of the first comer however cool and fresh they might be but anonymous with no secret with no distinction those of which i had so long been dreaming would be to know the taste the savour of a colour on which i had endlessly gazed one has seen a woman a mere image in the decorative setting of life like albertine outlined against the sea and then one has been able to take that image to detach it to bring it close to oneself gradually to discern its solidity its colours as though one had placed it behind the glasses of a stereoscope it is for this reason that the women who are a little difficult whose resistance one does not at once overcome of whom one does not indeed know at first whether one ever will overcome it are alone interesting for to know them to approach them to conquer them is to make fluctuate in form in dimensions in relief the human image is an example of relativity in the appreciation of an image which it is delightful to see afresh when it has resumed the slender proportions of a silhouette in the setting of ones life the women one meets first of all in a brothel are of no interest because they remain invariable in addition albertine preserved inseparably attached to her all my impressions of a series of seascapes of which i was particularly fond i felt that it was possible for me on the girls two cheeks to kiss the whole of the beach at balbec if you really do not mind my kissing you i would rather put it off for a little and choose a good moment only you must not forget that you have said i may i shall want a voucher valid for one kiss shall i have to sign it but if i took it now should i be entitled to another later on you do make me laugh with your vouchers i shall issue a new one every now and then tell me just one thing more you know at balbec before i had been introduced to you you used often to have a hard calculating look you cannot tell me what you were thinking about when you looked like that no i do not remember at all wait this may remind you one day your friend gisele put her feet together and jumped over the chair an old gentleman was sitting in try to remember what was in your mind at that moment gisele was the one we saw least of she did belong to the band i suppose but not properly i expect i thought that she was very illbred and common oh is that all i should certainly have liked before kissing her to be able to fill her afresh with the mystery which she had had for me on the beach before i knew her to find latent in her the place in which she had lived earlier still for that at any rate if i knew nothing of it i could substitute all my memories of our life at balbec the sound of the waves rolling up and breaking beneath my window the shouts of the children but when i let my eyes glide over the charming pink globe of her cheeks the gently curving surfaces of which ran up to expire beneath the first foothills of her piled black tresses which ran in undulating mountain chains thrust out escarped ramparts and moulded the hollows of deep valleys i could not help saying to myself now at last after failing at balbec i am going to learn the fragrance of the secret rose that blooms in albertines cheeks and since the cycles through which we are able to make things and people pass in the course of our existence are comparatively few perhaps i ought now to regard mine as nearing its end when having made to emerge from its remoteness the flowering face that i had chosen from among all others i shall have brought it into this new plane in which i shall at last acquire a tactual experience of it with my lips i told myself this because i believed that there was such a thing as knowledge acquired by the lips i told myself that i was going to know the taste of this fleshly rose because i had never stopped to think that man a creature obviously less rudimentary in structure than the seaurchin or even the whale is nevertheless still unprovided with a certain number of essential organs and notably possesses none that will serve for kissing the place of this absent organ he supplies with his lips and thereby arrives perhaps at a slightly more satisfying result than if he were reduced to caressing the beloved with a horny tusk but a pair of lips designed to convey to the palate the taste of whatever whets the appetite must be content without ever realising their mistake or admitting their disappointment with roaming over the surface and with coming to a halt at the barrier of the impenetrable but irresistible cheek besides at such moments at the actual contact between flesh and flesh the lips even supposing them to become more expert and better endowed could taste no better probably the savour which nature prevents their ever actually grasping for in that desolate zone in which they are unable to find their proper nourishment they are alone the sense of sight then that of smell have long since deserted them to begin with as my mouth began gradually to approach the cheeks which my eyes had suggested to it that it should kiss my eyes changing their position saw a different pair of cheeks the throat studied at closer range and as though through a magnifying glass shewed in its coarse grain a robustness which modified the character of the face apart from the most recent applications of the art of photography which set crouching at the foot of a cathedral all the houses which time and again when we stood near them have appeared to us to reach almost to the height of the towers drill and deploy like a regiment in file in open order in mass the same famous and familiar structures bring into actual contact the two columns on the piazzetta which a moment ago were so far apart thrust away the adjoining dome of the salute and in a pale and toneless background manage to include a whole immense horizon within the span of a bridge in the embrasure of a window among the leaves of a tree that stands in the foreground and is portrayed in a more vigorous tone give successively as setting to the same church the arched walls of all the others i can think of nothing that can so effectively as a kiss evoke from what we believe to be a thing with one definite aspect the hundred other things which it may equally well be since each is related to a view of it no less legitimate in short just as at balbec albertine had often appeared to me different so now as if wildly accelerating the speed of the changes of aspect and changes of colouring which a person presents to us in the course of our various encounters i had sought to contain them all in the space of a few seconds so as to reproduce experimentally the phenomenon which diversifies the individuality of a fellow creature and to draw out one from another like a nest of boxes all the possibilities that it contains in this brief passage of my lips towards her cheek it was ten albertines that i saw this single girl being like a goddess with several heads that which i had last seen if i tried to approach it gave place to another at least so long as i had not touched it that head i could still see it a faint perfume reached me from it but alas for in this matter of kissing our nostrils and eyes are as ill placed as our lips are shaped suddenly my eyes ceased to see next my nose crushed by the collision no longer perceived any fragrance and without thereby gaining any clearer idea of the taste of the rose of my desire i learned from these unpleasant signs that at last i was in the act of kissing albertines cheek was it because we were enacting as may be illustrated by the rotation of a solid body the con of our scene together at balbec because it was i now who was lying in bed and she who sat beside me capable of evading any brutal attack and of dictating her pleasure to me that she allowed me to take so easily now what she had refused me on the former occasion with so forbidding a frown no doubt from that same frown the voluptuous expression which her face assumed now at the approach of my lips differed only by a deviation of its lines immeasurably minute but one in which may be contained all the disparity that there is between the gesture of finishing off a wounded man and that of bringing him relief between a sublime and a hideous portrait not knowing whether i had to give the credit and to feel grateful for this change of attitude to some unwitting benefactor who in these last months in paris or at balbec had been working on my behalf i supposed that the respective positions in which we were now placed might account for it it was quite another explanation however that albertine offered me this in short oh well you see that time at balbec i did not know you properly for all i knew you might have meant mischief this argument left me in perplexity albertine was no doubt sincere in advancing it so difficult is it for a woman to recognise in the movements of her limbs in the sensations felt by her body in the course of an intimate conversation with a friend the unknown sin into which she would tremble to think that a stranger was planning her fall in any case whatever the modifications that had occurred at some recent time in her life which might perhaps have explained why it was that she now readily accorded to my momentary and purely physical desire what at balbec she had with horror refused to allow to my love another far more surprising manifested itself in albertine that same evening as soon as her caresses had procured in me the satisfaction which she could not have failed to notice which indeed i had been afraid might provoke in her the instinctive movement of revulsion and offended modesty which gilberte had given at a corresponding moment behind the laurel shrubbery in the champselysées the exact opposite happened already when i had first made her lie on my bed and had begun to fondle her albertine had assumed an air which i did not remember in her of docile good will of an almost childish simplicity obliterating every trace of her customary anxieties and interests the moment preceding pleasure similar in this respect to the moment after death had restored to her rejuvenated features what seemed like the innocence of earliest childhood and no doubt everyone whose special talent is suddenly brought into play becomes modest devoted charming especially if by this talent he knows that he is giving us a great pleasure he is himself happy in the display of it anxious to present it to us in as complete a form as possible but in this new expression on albertines face there was more than a mere profession of disinterestedness conscience generosity a sort of conventional and unexpected devotion and it was farther than to her own childhood it was to the infancy of the race that she had reverted very different from myself who had looked for nothing more than a physical alleviation which i had finally secured albertine seemed to feel that it would indicate a certain coarseness on her part were she to seem to believe that this material pleasure could be unaccompanied by a moral sentiment or was to be regarded as terminating anything she who had been in so great a hurry a moment ago now presumably because she felt that kisses implied love and that love took precedence of all other duties said when i reminded her of her dinner oh but that does not matter in the least i have plenty of time she seemed embarrassed by the idea of getting up and going immediately after what had happened embarrassed by good manners just as françoise when without feeling thirsty she had felt herself bound to accept with a seemly gaiety the glass of wine which jupien offered her would never have dared to leave him as soon as the last drops were drained however urgent the call of duty albertine and this was perhaps with another which the reader will learn in due course one of the reasons which bad made me unconsciously desire her was one of the incarnations of the little french peasant whose type may be seen in stone at saintandrédeschamps as in françoise who presently nevertheless was to become her deadly enemy i recognised in her a courtesy towards friend and stranger a sense of decency of respect for the bedside françoise who after the death of my aunt felt obliged to speak only in a plaintive tone would in the months that preceded her daughters marriage have been quite shocked if when the young couple walked out together the girl had not taken her lovers arm albertine lying motionless beside me said what nice hair you have what nice eyes you are a dear boy when after pointing out to her that it was getting late i added you do not believe me she replied what was perhaps true but could be so only since the minute before and for the next few hours i always believe you she spoke to me of myself my family my social position she said oh i know your parents know some very nice people you are a friend of robert forestier and suzanne delage for the moment these names conveyed absolutely nothing to me but suddenly i remembered that i had indeed played as a child in the champselysées with robert forestier whom i had never seen since then as for suzanne delage she was the greatniece of mme blatin and i had once been going to a dancing lesson and had even promised to take a small part in a play that was being acted in her mothers drawingroom but the fear of being sent into fits of laughter and of a bleeding nose had made me decline so that i had never set eyes on her i had at the most a vague idea that i had once heard that the swanns governess with the feather in her hat had at one time been with the delages but perhaps it was only a sister of this governess or a friend i protested to albertine that robert forestier and suzanne delage occupied a very small place in my life that may be but your mothers are friends i can place you by that i often pass suzanne delage in the avenue de messine i admire her style our mothers were acquainted only in the imagination of mme bontemps who having heard that i had at one time played with robert forestier to whom it appeared i used to recite poetry had concluded from that that we were bound by family ties she could never i gathered hear my mothers name mentioned without observing oh yes she is in the delage forestier set giving my parents a good mark which they had done nothing to deserve apart from this albertines social ideas were fatuous in the extreme she regarded the simonnets with a double n as inferior not only to the simonets with a single n but to everyone in the world that some one else should bear the same name as yourself without belonging to your family is an excellent reason for despising him of course there are exceptions it may happen that two simonnets introduced to one another at one of those gatherings where one feels the need to con no matter on what subject and where moreover one is instinctively well disposed towards strangers for instance in a funeral procession on its way to the cemetery finding that they have the same name will seek with a mutual friendliness though without success to discover a possible connexion but that is only an exception plenty of people are of dubious character but we either know nothing or care nothing about them if however a similarity of names brings to our door letters addressed to them or vice versa we at once feel a mistrust often justified as to their moral worth we are afraid of being confused with them we forestall the mistake by a grimace of disgust when anyone refers to them in our hearing when we read our own name as borne by them in the newspaper they seem to have usurped it the transgressions of other members of the social organism leave us cold we lay the burden of them more heavily upon our namesakes the hatred which we bear towards the other simonnets is all the stronger in that it is not a personal feeling but has been transmitted by heredity after the second generation we remember only the expression of disgust with which our grandparents used to refer to the other simonnets we know nothing of the reason we should not be surprised to learn that it had begun with a murder until as is not uncommon the time comes when a male and female simonnet who are not related in any way are joined together in matrimony and so repair the breach not only did albertine speak to me of robert forestier and suzanne delage but spontaneously with that impulse to confide which the approximation of two human bodies creates that is to say at first before it has engendered a special duplicity and reticence in one person towards the other she told me a story about her own family and one of andrées uncles as to which at balbec she had refused to utter a word thinking that now she ought not to appear to have any secrets in which i might not share from this moment had her dearest friend said anything to her against me she would have made it her duty to inform me i insisted upon her going home and finally she did go but so ashamed on my account at my discourtesy that she laughed almost as though to apologise for me as a hostess to whose party you have gone without dressing makes the best of you but is offended nevertheless are you laughing at me i inquired i am not laughing i am smiling at you she replied lovingly when am i going to see you again she went on as though declining to admit that what had just happened between us since it is generally the crowning consummation might not be at least the prelude to a great friendship a friendship already existing which we should have to discover to confess and which alone could account for the surrender we had made of ourselves since you give me leave i shall send for you when i can i dared not let her know that i was subordinating everything else to the chance of seeing mme de stermaria it will have to be at short notice unfortunately i went on i never know beforehand would it be possible for me to send round for you in the evenings when i am free it will be quite possible in a little while i am going to have a latchkey of my own but just at present it cannot be done anyhow i shall come round tomorrow or next day in the afternoon you need not see me if you are busy on reaching the door surprised that i had not anticipated her she offered me her cheek feeling that there was no need now for any coarse physical desire to prompt us to kiss one another the brief relations in which we had just indulged being of the sort to which an absolute intimacy and a heartfelt choice often tend albertine had felt it incumbent upon her to improvise and add provisionally to the kisses which we had exchanged on my bed the sentiment of which those kisses would have been the symbol for a knight and his lady such as they might have been conceived in the mind of a gothic minstrel when she had left me this young picard who might have been carved on his porch by the imagemaker of saintandrédeschamps françoise brought me a letter which filled me with joy for it was from mme de stermaria who accepted my invitation to dinner from mme de stermaria that was to say for me not so much from the real mme de stermaria as from her of whom i had been thinking all day before albertines arrival it is the terrible deception of love that it begins by engaging us in play not with a woman of the external world but with a puppet fashioned and kept in our brain the only form of her moreover that we have always at our disposal the only one that we shall ever possess one which the arbitrary power of memory almost as absolute as that of imagination may have made as different from the real woman as had been from the real balbec the balbec of my dreams an artificial creation to which by degrees and to our own hurt we shall force the real woman into resemblance albertine had made me so late that the play had just finished when i entered mme de villeparisiss drawingroom and having little desire to be caught in the stream of guests who were pouring out discussing the great piece of news the separation said to be already effected of the duc de guermantes from his wife i had until i should have an opportunity of shaking hands with my hostess taken my seat on an empty sofa in the outer room when from the other in which she had no doubt had her chair in the very front row of all i saw emerging majestic ample and tall in a flowing gown of yellow satin upon which stood out in relief huge black poppies the duchess herself the sight of her no longer disturbed me in the least there had been a day when laying her hands on my forehead as was her habit when she was afraid of hurting my feelings and saying you really must stop hanging about trying to meet mme de guermantes all the neighbours are talking about you besides look how ill your grandmother is you really have something more serious to think about than waylaying a woman who only laughs at you in a moment like a hypnotist who brings one back from the distant country in which one imagined oneself to be and opens ones eyes for one or like the doctor who by recalling one to a sense of duty and reality cures one of an imaginary disease in which one has been indulging ones fancy my mother had awakened me from an unduly protracted dream the rest of the day had been consecrated to a last farewell to this malady which i was renouncing i had sung for hours on end and weeping as i sang the sad words of schuberts adieu farewell strange voices call thee away from me dear sister of the angels and then it had finished i had given up my morning walks and with so little difficulty that i thought myself justified in the prophecy which we shall see was to prove false later on that i should easily grow accustomed in the course of my life to ceasing to see a woman and when shortly afterwards françoise had reported to me that jupien anxious to enlarge his business was looking for a shop in the neighbourhood wishing to find one for him quite happy moreover when strolling along a street which already from my bed i had heard luminously vociferous like a peopled beach to see behind the raised iron shutters of the dairies the young milkgirls with their white sleeves i had been able to begin these excursions again nor did i feel the slightest constraint for i was conscious that i was no longer going out with the object of seeing mme de guermantes much as a married woman who takes endless precautions so long as she has a lover from the day on which she has broken with him leaves his letters lying about at the risk of disclosing to her husband an infidelity which ceased to alarm her the moment she ceased to be guilty of it what troubled me now was the discovery that almost every house sheltered some unhappy person in one the wife was always in tears because her husband was unfaithful to her in the next it was the other way about in another a hardworking mother beaten black and blue by a drunkard son was endeavouring to conceal her sufferings from the eyes of the neighbours quite half of the human race was in tears and when i came to know the people who composed it i saw that they were so exasperating that i asked myself whether it might not be the adulterous husband and wife who were so simply because their lawful happiness had been withheld from them and shewed themselves charming and faithful to everyone but their respective wife and husband who were in the right presently i ceased to have even the excuse of being useful to jupien for continuing my morning wanderings for we learned that the cabinetmaker in our courtyard whose workrooms were separated from jupiens shop only by the flimsiest of partitions was shortly to be given notice by the dukes agent because his hammering made too much noise jupien could have hoped for nothing better the workrooms had a basement for storing timber which communicated with our cellars he could keep his coal in this he could knock down the partition and would then have a huge shop all in one room but even without the amusement of househunting on his behalf i had continued to go out every day before luncheon just as jupien himself finding the rent that m de guermantes was asking him exorbitant was allowing the premises to be inspected in the hope thatdiscouraged by his failure to find a tenant the duke would resign himself to accepting a lower offer françoise noticing that even at an hour when no prospective tenant was likely to call the porter left the door of the empty shop on the latch scented a trap laid by him to entice the young woman who was engaged to the guer mantes footman they would find a lovers retreat there and to catch them redhanded however that might be and for all that i had no longer to find jupien a new shop i still went out before luncheon often on these excursions i met m de norpois it would happen that conversing as he walked with a colleague he cast at me a glance which after making a thorough scrutiny of my person returned to his companion without his having smiled at me or given me any more sign of recognition than if he had never set eyes on me before for with these eminent diplomats looking at you in a certain way is intended to let you know not that they have seen you but that they have not seen you and that they have some serious question to discuss with the colleague who is accompanying them a tall woman whom i frequently encountered near the house was less discreet with me for in spite of the fact that i did not know her she would turn round to look at me would wait for me unavailingly before shop windows smile at me as though she were going to kiss me make gestures indicative of a complete surrender she resumed an icy coldness towards me if anyone appeared whom she knew for a long time now in these morning walks thinking only of what i had to do were it but the most trivial purchase of a newspaper i had chosen the shortest way with no regret were it outside the ordinary course which the duchess followed in her walks and if on the other hand it lay along that course without either compunction or concealment because it no longer appeared to me the forbidden way on which i should snatch from an ungrateful woman the favour of setting eyes on her against her will but it had never occurred to me that my recovery when it restored me to a normal attitude towards mme de guermantes would have a corresponding effect on her and so render possible a friendliness even a friendship in which i no longer felt any interest until then the efforts of the entire world banded together to bring me into touch with her would have been powerless to counteract the evil spell that is cast by an illstarred love fairies more powerful than mankind have decreed that in such cases nothing can avail us until the day on which we have uttered sincerely and from our hearts the formula i am no longer in love i had been vexed with saintloup for not having taken me to see his aunt but he was no more capable than anyone else of breaking an enchantment so long as i was in love with mme de guermantes the marks of politeness that i received from others their compliments actually distressed me not only because they did not come from her but because she would never hear of them and yet even if she had known of them it would not have been of the slightest use to me indeed among the lesser auxiliaries to success in iove an absence the declining of an invitation to dinner an unintentional unconscious harshness are of more service than all the cosmetics and fine clothes in the world there would be plenty of social success were people taught upon these lines the art of succeeding as she swept through the room in which i was sitting her mind filled with thoughts of friends whom i did not know and whom she would perhaps be meeting presently at some other party mme de guermantes caught sight of me on my sofa genuinely indifferent and seeking only to be polite whereas while i was in love i had tried so desperately without ever succeeding to assume an air of indifference she swerved aside came towards me and reproducing the smile she had worn that evening at the opéracomique which the unpleasant feeling of being cared for by some one for whom she did not care was no longer there to obliterate no do not move you do not mind if i sit down beside you for a moment she asked gracefully gathering in her immense skirt which otherwise would have covered the entire sofa of less stature than she who was further expanded by the volume of her gown i was almost brushed by her exquisite bare arm round which a faint innumerable down rose in perpetual smoke like a golden mist and by the fringe of her fair tresses which wafted their fragrance over me having barely room to sit down she could not turn easily to face me and so obliged to look straight before her rather than in my direction assumed the sort of dreamy sweet expression one sees in a portrait have you any news of robert she inquired at that moment mme de villeparisis entered the room well sir you arrive at a fine time when we do see you here for once in a way and noticing that i was talking to her niece concluding perhaps that we were more intimate than she had supposed but do not let me interrupt your conversation with oriane she went on and for these good offices as pander are part of the duties of the perfect hostess you would not care to dine with her here on thursday it was the day on which i was to entertain mme de stermaria so i declined saturday then as my mother was returning on saturday or sunday it would never do for me not to stay at home every evening to dine with her i therefore declined this invitation also ah you are not an easy person to get hold of why do you never come to see me inquired mme de guermantes when mme de villeparisis had left us to go and congratulate the performers and present the leading lady with a bunch of roses upon which the hand that offered it conferred all its value for it had cost no more than twenty francs this incidentally was as high as she ever went when an artist had performed only once those who gave their services at all her afternoons and evenings throughout the season received roses painted by the marquise it is such a bore that we never see each other except in other peoples houses since you will not meet me at dinner at my aunts why not come and dine with me various people who had stayed to the last possible moment upon one pretext or another but were at length preparing to leave seeing that the duchess had sat down to talk to a young man on a seat so narrow as just to contain them both thought that they must have been misinformed that it was the duchess and not the duke who was seeking a separation and on my account whereupon they hastened to spread abroad this intelligence i had better grounds than anyone to be aware of its falsehood but i was myself surprised that at one of those difficult periods in which a separation that is not yet completed is beginning to take effect the duchess instead of withdrawing from society should go out of her way to invite a person whom she knew so slightly the suspicion crossed my mind that it had been the duke alone who had been opposed to her having me in the house and that now that he was leaving her she saw no further obstacle to her surrounding herself with the people that she liked a minute earlier i should have been stupefied had anyone told me that mme de guermantes was going to ask me to call on her let alone to dine with her i might be perfectly aware that the guermantes drawingroom could not furnish those particular refinements which i had extracted from the name of its occupants the fact that it had been forbidden ground to me by obliging me to give it the same kind of existence that we give to the drawingrooms of which we have read the description in a novel or seen the image in a dream made me even when i was certain that it was just like any other imagine it as quite different between myself and it was the barrier at which reality ends to dine with the guermantes was like travelling to a place i had long wished to see making a desire emerge from my brain and take shape before my eyes forming acquaintance with a dream at the most i might have supposed that it would be one of those dinners to which ones hosts invite one with do come there will beabsolutely nobody but ourselves pretending to attribute to the pariah the alarm which they themselves feel at the thought of his mixing with their other friends seeking indeed to convert into an enviable privilege reserved for their intimates alone the quarantine of the outsider hopelessly uncouth whom they are befriending i felt on the contrary that mme de guermantes was anxious for me to enjoy the most delightful society that she had to offer me when she went on projecting as she spoke before my eyes as it were the violethued loveliness of a visit to fabrices aunt with the miracle of an introduction to count mosca on friday now could not you there are just a few people coming the princesse de parme who is charming not that i would ask you to meet anyone who was not nice discarded in the intermediate social grades which are engaged in a perpetual upward movement the family still plays an important part in certain stationary grades such as the lower middle class and the semiroyal aristocracy which latter cannot seek to raise itself since above it from its own special point of view there exists nothing higher the friendship shewn me by her aunt villeparisis and robert had perhaps made me for mme de guermantes and her friends living always upon themselves and in the same little circle the object of a curious interest of which i had no suspicion she had of those two relatives a familiar everyday homely knowledge of a sort utterly different from what we imagine in which if we happen to be comprised in it so far from our actions being at once ejected like the grain of dust from the eye or the drop of water from the windpipe they are capable of remaining engraved and will still be related and discussed years after we ourselves have forgotten them in the palace in which we are astonished to find them preserved like a letter in our own handwriting among a priceless collection of autographs people who are merely fashionable may set a guard upon doors which are too freely invalided but the guermantes door was not that hardly ever did a stranger have occasion to pass by it if for once in a way the duchess had one pointed out to her she never dreamed of troubling herself about the social increment that he would bring since this was a thing that she conferred and could not receive she thought only of his real merits both mme de villeparisis and saintloup had testified to mine doubtless she might not have believed them if she had not at the same time observed that they could never manage to secure me when they wanted me and therefore that i attached no importance to worldly things which seemed to the duchess a sign that the stranger was to be numbered among what she called nice people it was worth seeing when one spoke to her of women for whom she did not care how her face changed as soon as one named in connexion with one of these let us say her sisterinlaw oh she is charming the duchess would exclaim in a judicious confident tone the only reason that she gave was that this lady had declined to be introduced to the marquise de chaussegros and the princesse de silistrie she did not add that the lady had declined also an introduction to herself the duchesse de guermantes this had nevertheless been the case and ever since the mind of the duchess had been at work trying to unravel the motives of a woman who was so hard to know she was dying to be invited to call on her people in society are so accustomed to be sought after that the person who shuns them seems to them a phoenix and at once monopolises their attention was the true motive in the mind of mme de guermantes for thus inviting me now that i was no longer in love with her that i did not run after her relatives although apparently run after myself by them i cannot say in any case having made up her mind to invite me she was anxious to do me the honours of the best company at her disposal and to keep away those of her friends whose presence might have dissuaded me from coming again those whom she knew to be boring i had not known to what to attribute her change of direction when i had seen her deviate from her stellar path come to sit down beside me and had heard her invite me to dinner the effect of causes unknown for want of a special sense to enlighten us in this respect we picture to ourselves the people who know us but slightly such as in my case the duchesse de guermantes as thinking of us only at the rare moments at which they set eyes on us as a matter of fact this ideal oblivion in which we picture them as holding us is a purely arbitrary conception on our part so that while in our solitary silence like that of a cloudless night we imagine the various queens of society pursuing their course in the heavens at an infinite distance we cannot help an involuntary start of dismay or pleasure if there falls upon us from that starry height like a meteorite engraved with our name which we supposed to be unknown on venus or cassiopeia an invitation to dinner or a piece of malicious gossip perhaps now and then when following the example of the persian princes who according to the book of esther made their scribes read out to them the registers in which were enrolled the names of those of their subjects who had shewn zeal in their service mme de guermantes consulted her list of the welldisposed she had said to herself on coming to my name a man we must ask to dine some day but other thoughts had distracted her beset by surging cares a princes mind towards fresh matters ever is inclined until the moment when she had caught sight of me sitting alone like mordecai at the palace gate and the sight of me having refreshed her memory sought like ahasuerus to lavish her gifts upon me i must at the same time add that a surprise of a totally different sort was to follow that which i had felt on hearing mme de guermantes ask me to dine with her since i had decided that it would shew greater modesty on my part and gratitude also not to conceal this initial surprise but rather to exaggerate my expression of the delight that it gave me mme de guermantes who was getting ready to go on to another final party had said to me almost as a justification and for fear of my not being quite certain who she was since i appeared so astonished at being invited to dine with her you know i am the aunt of robert de saintloup who is such a friend of yours besides we have met before in replying that i was aware of this i added that i knew also m de charlus who had been very good to me at balbec and in paris mme de guermantes appeared dumbfoundered and her eyes seemed to turn as though for a verification of this statement to some page already filled and turned of her internal register of events what so you know palamede do you this name assumed on the lips of mme de guermantes a great charm due to the instinctive simplicity with which she spoke of a man who was socially so brilliant a figure but for her was no more than her brotherinlaw and the cousin with whom she had grown up and on the confused greyness which the life of the duchesse de guermantes was for me this name palamede she would as it were the radiance of long summer days on which she had played with him as a girl at guermantes in the garden moreover in this long outgrown period in their lives oriane de guermantes and her cousin palamede had been very different from what they had since become m de charlus in particular entirely absorbed in the artistic pursuits from which he had so effectively restrained himself in later life that i was stupefied to learn that it was he who had painted the huge fan with black and yellow irises which the duchess was at this moment unfurling she could also have shewn me a little sonatina which he had once composed for her i was completely unaware that the baron possessed all these talents of which he never spoke let me remark in passing that m de charlus did not at all relish being called palamede by his family that the form mémé might not please him one could easily understand these stupid abbreviations are a sign of the utter inability of the aristocracy to appreciate its own poetic beauty in jewry too we may see the same defect since a nephew of lady israels whose name was moses was commonly known as momo concurrently with its anxiety not to appear to attach any importance to what is aristocratic now m de charlus had in this connexion a greater wealth of poetic imagination and a more blatant pride but the reason for his distaste for mémé could not be this since it extended also to the fine name palamede the truth was that considering knowing himself to come of a princely stock he would have liked his brother and sisterinlaw to refer to him as charlus just as queen marieamélie and duc dorléans might have spoken of their sons and grandsons brothers and nephews as joinville nemours chartres paris what a humbug mémé is she exclaimed we talked to him about you for hours he told us that he would be delighted to make your acquaintance just as if he had never set eyes on you you must admit he is odd and though it is not very nice of me to say such a thing about a brotherinlaw i am devoted to and really do admire immensely a trifle mad at times i was struck by the application of this last epithet to m de charlus and said to myself that this halfmadness might perhaps account for certain things such as his having appeared so delighted by his own proposal that i should ask bloch to castigate his mother i decided that by reason not only of the things he said but of the way in which he said them m de charlus must be a little mad the first time that one listens to a barrister or an actor one is surprised by his tone so different from the conversational but observing that everyone else seems to find this quite natural one says nothing about it to other people one says nothing in fact to oneself one is content with appreciating the degree of talent shewn at the most one may think of an actor at the théâtrefrançais why instead of letting his raised arm fall naturally did he make it drop in a series of little jerks broken by pauses for at least ten minutes or of a labori why whenever he opened his mouth did he utter those tragic unexpected sounds to express the simplest things but as everybody admits these actions to be necessary and obvious one is not shocked by them so upon thinking it over one said to oneself that m de charlus spoke of himself with undue emphasis in a tone which was not in the least that of ordinary speech it seemed as though one might have at any moment interrupted him with but why do you shout so why are you so offensive only everyone seemed to have tacitly agreed that it was all right and one took ones place in the circle which applauded his outbursts but certainly at certain moments a stranger might have thought that he was listening to the ravings of a maniac but are you sure you are not thinking of some one else do you really mean my brotherinlaw palamede went on the duchess a trace of impertinence grafted upon her natural simplicity i replied that i was absolutely sure and that m de charlus must have failed to catch my name oh well i shall leave you now said mme de guermantes as though she regretted the parting i must look in for a moment at the princesse de lignes you are not going on there no you do not care for parties you are very wise they are too boring for words if only i had not got to go but she is my cousin it would not be polite i am sorry selfishly for my own sake because i could have taken you there and brought you back afterwards too so i shall say goodbye now and look forward to friday that m de charlus should have blushed to be seen with me by m dargencourt was all very well but that to his own sisterinlaw who had so high an opinion of him besides he should deny all knowledge of me knowledge which was perfectly natural seeing that i was a friend of both his aunt and his nephew was a thing that i could not understand i shall end my account of this incident with the remark that from one point of view there was in mme de guermantes a true greatness which consisted in her entirely obliterating from her memory what other people would have only partially forgotten had she never seen me waylaying her following her tracking her down as she took her morning walks had she never responded to my daily salute with an angry impatience had she never refused saintloup when he begged her to invite me to her house she could not have greeted me now in a nobler or more gracious manner not only did she waste no time in retrospective explanations in hints allusions or ambiguous smiles not only was there in her present affability without any harking back to the past without any reticence something as proudly rectilinear as her majestic stature but the resentment which she might have felt against anyone in the past was so entirely reduced to ashes the ashes were themselves cast so utterly from her memory or at least from her manner that on studying her face whenever she had occasion to treat with the most exquisite simplification what in so many other people would have been a pretext for reviving stale antipathies and recriminations one had the impression of an intense purity of mind but if i was surprised by the modification that had occurred in her opinion of me how much more did it surprise me to find a similar but ever so much greater change in my feeling for her had there not been a time during which i could regain life and strength only if always building new castles in the air i had found some one who would obtain for me an invitation to her house and after this initial boon would procure many others for my increasingly exacting heart it was the impossibility of finding any avenue there that had made me leave paris for doncieres to visit robert de saintloup and now it was indeed by the consequence of a letter from him that i was agitated but on account this time of mme de stermaria not of mme de guermantes let me add further to conclude my account of this party that there occurred at it an incident contradicted a few days later which continued to puzzle me interrupted for some time my friendship with bloch and constitutes in itself one of those curious paradoxes the explanation of which will be found in the next part of this work at this party at mme de villeparisiss bloch kept on boasting to me about the friendly attentions shewn him by m de charlus who when he passed him in the street looked him straight in the face as though he recognised him was anxious to know him personally knew quite well who he was i smiled at first bloch having expressed so vehemently at balbec his contempt for the said m de charlus and i supposed merely that bloch like his father in the case of bergotte knew the baron without actually knowing him and that what he took for a friendly glance was due to absentmindedness but finally bloch became so precise and appeared so confident that on two or three occasions m de charlus had wished to address him that remembering that i had spoken of my friend to the baron who had as we walked away together from this very house as it happened asked me various questions about him i came to the conclusion that bloch was not lying that m de charlus had heard his name realised that he was my friend and so forth and so a little later at the theatre one evening i asked m de charlus if i might introduce bloch to him and on his assenting went in search of my friend but as soon as m de charlus caught sight of him an expression of astonishment instantly repressed appeared on his face where it gave way to a blazing fury not only did he not offer bloch his hand but whenever bloch spoke to him he replied in the most insolent manner in an angry and wounding tone so that bloch who according to his version had received nothing until then from the baron but smiles assumed that i had not indeed commended but disparaged him in the short speech in which knowing m de charluss liking for formal procedure i had told him about my friend before bringing him up to be introduced bloch left us his spirit broken like a man who has been trying to mount a horse which is always ready to take the bit in its teeth or to swim against waves which continually dash him back on the shingle and did not speak to me again for six months the days that preceded my dinner with mme de stermaria were for me by no means delightful in fact it was all i could do to live through them for as a general rule the shorter the interval is that separates us from our planned objective the longer it seems to us because we apply to it a more minute scale of measurement or simply because it occurs to us to measure it at all the papacy we are told reckons by centuries and indeed may not think perhaps of reckoning time at all since its goal is in eternity mine was no more than three days off i counted by seconds i gave myself up to those imaginings which are the first movements of caresses of caresses which it maddens us not to be able to make the woman herself reciprocate and complete those identical caresses to the exclusion of all others and as a matter of fact it is true that generally speaking the difficulty of attaining to the object of a desire enhances that desire the difficulty not the impossibility for that suppresses it altogether yet in the case of a desire that is wholly physical the certainty that it will be realised at a fixed and not distant point in time is scarcely less exciting than uncertainty almost as much as an anxious doubt the absence of doubt makes intolerable the period of waiting for the pleasure that is bound to come because it makes of that suspense an innumerably rehearsed accomplishment and by the frequency of our proleptic representations divides time into sections as minute as could be carved by agony what i required was to possess mme de stermaria for during the last few days with an incessant activity my desires had been preparing this pleasure in my imagination and this pleasure alone for any other kind pleasure that is taken with another woman would not have been ready pleasure being but the realisation of a previous wish and of one which is not always the same but changes according to the endless combinations of ones fancies the accidents of ones memory the state of ones temperament the variability of ones desires the most recently granted of which lie dormant until the disappointment of their satisfaction has been to some extent forgotten i should not have been prepared i had already turned from the main road of general desires and had ventured along the bridlepath of a particular desire i should have had in order to wish for a different assignation to retrace my steps too far before rejoining the main road and taking another path to take possession of mme de stermaria on the island in the bois de boulogne where i had asked her to dine with me this was the pleasure that i imagined to myself afresh every moment it would have automatically perished if i had dined on that island without mme de stermaria but perhaps as greatly diminished had i dined even with her somewhere else besides the attitudes in which one pictures a pleasure to oneself exist previously to the woman to the type of woman required to give one that pleasure they dictate the pleasure and the place as well and on that account bring to the fore alternatively in our capricious fancy this or that woman this or that scene this or that room which in other weeks we should have dismissed with contempt child of the attitude that produced her one woman will not appeal to us without the large bed in which we find peace by her side while others to be caressed with a more secret intention require leaves blown by the wind water rippling in the night are as frail and fleeting as they no doubt in the past long before i received saintloups letter and when there was as yet no question of mme de stermaria the island in the bois had seemed to me to be specially designed for pleasure because i had found myself going there to taste the bitterness of having no pleasure to enjoy in its shelter it is to the shores of the lake from which one goes to that island and along which in the last weeks of summer those ladies of paris who have not yet left for the country take the air that not knowing where to look for her or if indeed she has not already left paris one wanders in the hope of seeing the girl go by with whom one fell in love at the last ball of the season whom one will not have a chance of meeting again in any drawingroom until the following spring feeling it to be at least the eve if not the morrow of the beloveds departure one follows along the brink of the shivering water those attractive paths by which already a first red leaf is blooming like a last rose one scans that horizon where by a device the opposite of that employed in those panoramas beneath whose domed roofs the wax figures in the foreground impart to the painted canvas beyond them the illusory appearance of depth and mass our eyes passing without any transition from the cultivated park to the natural heights of meudon and the mont valérien do not know where to set the boundary and make the natural country trespass upon the handiwork of the gardener of which they project far beyond its own limits the artificial charm like those rare birds reared in the open in a botanical garden which every day in the liberty of their winged excursions sally forth to strike among the surrounding woods an exotic note between the last festivity of summer and ones winter exile one ranges anxiously that romantic world of chance encounters and lovers melancholy and one would be no more surprised to learn that it was situated outside the mapped uni than if at versailles looking down from the terrace an observatory round which the clouds are massed against a blue sky in the manner of van der meulen after having thus risen above the bounds of nature one were informed that there where nature begins again at the end of the great canal the villages which one just could not make out on a horizon as dazzling as the sea were called fleurus or nimegue and then the last carriage having rolled by when one feels with a throb of pain that she will not come now one goes to dine on the island above the shivering poplars which suggest endless mysteries of evening though without response a pink cloud paints a last touch of life in the tranquil sky a few drops of rain fall without noise on the water ancient but still in its diyine infancy coloured always by the weather and continually forgetting the reflexions of clouds and flowers and after the geraniums have vainly striven by intensifying the brilliance of their scarlet to resist the gathering darkness a mist rises to envelop the now slumbering island one walks in the moist dimness along the waters edge where at the most the silent passage of a swan startles one like in a bed at night the eyes for a moment wide open and the swift smile of a child whom one did not suppose to be awake then one would like to have with one a loving companion all the more as one feels oneself to be alone and can imagine oneself to be far away from the world but to this island where even in summer there was often a mist how much more gladly would i have brought mme de stermaria now that the cold season the back end of autumn had come if the weather that had prevailed since sunday had not by itself rendered grey and maritime the scenes in which my imagination was living as other seasons made them balmy luminous italian the hope of in a few days time making mme de stermaria mine would have been quite enough to raise twenty times in an hour a curtain of mist in my monotonously lovesick imagination in any event the mist which since yesterday had risen even in paris not only made me think incessantly of the native place of the young woman whom i had invited to dine with me but since it was probable that far more thickly than in the streets of the town it must after sunset be invading the bois especially the shores of the lake i thought that it would make the swans island for me something like that breton island the marine and misty atmosphere of which had always enwrapped in my mind like a garment the pale outline of mme de stermaria of course when we are young at the age i had reached at the period of my walks along the méséglise way our desires our faith bestow on a womans clothing an individual personality an ultimate quintessence we pursue reality but by dint of allowing it to escape we end by noticing that after all those vain endeavours which have led to nothing something solid subsists which is what we have been seeking we begin to separate to recognise what we love we try to procure it for ourselves be it only by a stratagem then in the absence of our vanished faith costume fills the gap by means of a deliberate illusion i knew quite well that within half an hour of home i should not find myself in brittany but in walking arm in arm with mme de stermaria in the dusk of the island by the waters edge i should be acting like other men who unable to penetrate the walls of a convent do at least before enjoying a woman clothe her in the habit of a nun i could even look forward to hearing as i sat with the lady the lapping of waves for on the day before our dinner a storm broke over paris i was beginning to shave myself before going to the island to engage the room albeit at this time of year the island was empty and the restaurant deserted and order the food for our dinner next day when françoise came in to tell me that albertine had called i made her come in at once indifferent to her finding me disfigured by a bristling chin her for whom at balbec i had never felt smart enough and who had cost me then as much agitation and distress as mme de stermaria was costing me now the latter i was determined must go away with the best possible impression from our evening together accordingly i asked albertine to come with me there and then to the island to order the food she to whom one gives everything is so quickly replaced by another that one is surprised to find oneself giving all that one has afresh at every moment without any hope of future reward at my suggestion the smiling rosy face beneath albertines flat cap which came down very low to her eyebrows seemed to hesitate she had probably other plans if so she sacrificed them willingly to my great satisfaction for i attached the utmost importance to my having with me a young housewife who would know a great deal more than myself about ordering dinner it is quite true that she had represented something utterly different for me at balbec but our intimacy even when we do not consider it close enough at the time with a woman with whom we are in love creates between her and us in spite of the shortcomings that pain us while our love lasts social ties which outlast our love and even the memory of our love then in her who is nothing more for us than a means of approach an avenue towards others we are just as astonished and amused to learn from our memory what her name meant originally to that other creature which we then were as if after giving a cabman an address in the boulevard des capucines or the rue du bac thinking only of the person whom we are going to see there we remind ourself that the names were once those of respectively the capuchin nuns whose convent stood on the site and the ferry across the seine at the same time my balbec desires had so generously ripened albertines body had gathered and stored in it savours so fresh and sweet that as we drove through the bois while the wind like a careful gardener shook the trees brought down the fruit swept up the fallen leaves i said to myself that had there been any risk of saintloups being mistaken or of my having misunderstood his letter so that my dinner with mme de stermaria might lead to no satisfactory result i should have made an appointment for the same evening later on with albertine so as to forget for a purely voluptuous hour as i held in my arms a body of which my curiosity had long since computed weighed up all the possible charms in which now it abounded the emotions and perhaps the regrets of this first phase of love for mme de stermaria and certainly if i could have supposed that mme de stermaria would not grant me any of her favours at our first meeting i should have formed a slightly depressing picture of my evening with her i knew too well from experience how the two stages which occur in us in the first phase of our love for a woman whom we have desired without knowing her loving in her rather the particular kind of existence in which she is steeped than her still unfamiliar self how distorted is the reflexion of those two stages in the world of facts that is to say not in ourselves any longer but in our meetings with her we have without ever having talked to her hesitated tempted as we were by the poetic charm which she represented for us shall it be this woman or another and lo our dreams become fixed round about her cease to have any separate existence from her the first meeting with her which will shortly follow should reflect this dawning love nothing of the sort as if it were necessary that our material life should have its first period also in love with her already we talk to her in the most trivial fashion i asked you to dine on this island because i thought the surroundings would amuse you i have nothing particular to say to you do not you know but it is rather damp i am afraid and you may find it cold oh no not at all you just say that out of politeness very well madame i shall allow you to battle against the cold for another quarter of an hour as i do not want to bother you but in fifteen minutes i shall carry you off by force i do not want to have you catching a chill and without another word said we take her home remembering nothing about her at the most a certain look in her eyes but thinking only of seeing her again well at our second meeting when we do not find even that look our sole memory of her but nevertheless have been thinking only of seeing her again the first stage is passed nothing has happened in the interval and yet instead of talking about the comfort or want of comfort of the restaurant we say without our words appearing to surprise the new person who seems to us positively plain but to whom we should like to think that people were talking about us at every moment in her life we are going to have our work cut out to overcome all the obstacles in our way do you think we shall be successful do you suppose that we can triumph over our enemies live happily ever afterwards and all that sort of thing but these conversational openings trivial to begin with then hinting at love would not be required i could trust saintloups letter for that mme de stermaria would yield herself to me from the first i should have no need therefore to engage albertine to come to me as a makeshift later in the evening it would be superfluous robert never exaggerated and his letter was explicit albertine spoke hardly at all conscious that my thoughts were elsewhere we went a little way on foot into the greenish almost submarine grotto of a dense mass of trees on the domed tops of which we heard the wind sweep and the rain pelt i trod underfoot dead leaves which like shells were trampled into the soil and poked with my stick at fallen chestnuts prickly as seaurchins on the boughs the last clinging leaves shaken by the wind followed it only as far as their stems would allow but sometimes these broke and they fell to the ground along which they coursed to overtake it i thought with joy how much more remote still if this weather lasted the island would be on the morrow and in any case quite deserted we returned to our carriage and as the storm had passed off albertine asked me to take her on to saintcloud as on the ground the drifting leaves so up above the clouds were chasing the wind and a stream of migrant evenings of which a sort of conic section cut through the sky made visible the successive layers pink blue and green were gathered in readiness for departure to warmer climes to obtain a closer view of a marble goddess who had been carved in the act of leaping from her pedestal and alone in a great wood which seemed to be consecrated to her filled it with the mythological terror half animal half divine of her frenzied bounding albertine climbed a grassy slope while i waited for her in the road she herself seen thus from below no longer coarse and plump as a few days earlier on my bed when the grain of her throat became apparent in the lens of my eye as it approached her person but chiselled and delicate seemed a little statue on which our happy hours together at balbec had left their patina when i found myself alone again at home and remembered that i had taken a drive that afternoon with albertine that i was to dine in two days time with mme de guermantes and that i had to answer a letter from gilberte three women each of whom i had once loved i said to myself that our social existence is like an artists studio filled with abandoned sketches in which we have fancied for a moment that we could set down in permanent form our need of a great love but it did not occur to me that sometimes if the sketch be not too old it may happen that we return to it and make of it a work wholly different and possibly more important than what we had originally planned the next day was cold and fine winter was in the air indeed the season was so far advanced that it had seemed miraculous that we should find in the already pillaged bois a few domes of gilded green when i awoke i saw as from the window of the barracks at doncieres a uniform dead white mist which hung gaily in the sunlight consistent and sweet as a web of spun sugar then the sun withdrew and the mist thickened still further in the afternoon night fell early i made ready for dinner but it was still too soon to start i decided to send a carriage for mme de stermaria i did not like to go for her in it myself not wishing to force my company on her but i gave the driver a note for her in which i asked whether she would mind my coming to call for her while i waited for her answer i lay down on my bed shut my eyes for a moment then opened them again over the top of the curtains there was nothing now but a thin strip of daylight which grew steadily fainter i recognised that wasted hour the large anteroom of pleasure the dark delicious emptiness of which i had learned at balbec to know and to enjoy when alone in my room as i was now while all the rest were at dinner i saw without regret the daylight fade from above my curtains knowing that presently after a night of arctic brevity it was to be resuscitated in a more dazzling brightness in the lighted rooms of rivebelle i sprang from my bed tied my black necktie passed a brush over my hair final gestures of a belated tidying carried out at balbec with my mind not on myself but on the women whom i should see at rivebelle while i smiled at them in anticipation in the mirror that stood across a corner of my room gestures which on that account had continued to herald a form of entertainment in which music and lights would be mingled like magic signs they summoned nay rather presented this entertainment already thanks to them i had of its intoxicating frivolous charm as complete an enjoyment as i had had at combray in the month of july when i heard the hammerblows ring on the packing cases and enjoyed in the coolness of my darkened room a sense of warmth and sunshine also it was no longer exactly mme de stermaria that i should have wished most to see forced now to spend my evening with her i should have preferred as it was almost the last before the return of my parents that it should remain free and myself try instead to find some of the women from rivebelle i gave my hands one more final wash and my sense of pleasure keeping me on the move dried them as i walked through the shuttered diningroom it appeared to have a door open on to the lighted hall but what i had taken for the bright chink of the door which as a matter of fact was closed was only the gleaming reflexion of my towel in a mirror that had been laid against the wall in readiness to be fixed in its place before mammas return i thought of all the other illusions of the sort which i had discovered in different parts of the house and which were not optical only for when we first came there i had supposed that our nextdoor neighbour kept a dog on account of the continuous almost human yapping which came from a certain pipe in the kitchen whenever the tap was turned on and the door on to the outer landing never closed by itself very gently caught by a draught on the staircase without rendering those broken voluptuous whimpering passages which sound over the chant of the pilgrims towards the end of overture to tannhäuser i had moreover just as i had put my towel back on its rail an opportunity of hearing a fresh rendering of this brilliant symphonic fragment for at a peal of the bell i hurried out to open the door to the driver who had come with mme de stermarias answer i thought that his message would be the lady is downstairs or the lady is waiting but he had a letter in his hand i hesitated for a moment before looking to see what mme de stermaria had written who while she held the pen in her hand might have been anything but was now detached from herself an engine of fate pursuing a course alone which she was utterly powerless to alter i asked the driver to wait downstairs for a moment although he was cursing the fog as soon as he had gone i opened the envelope on her card inscribed vicomtesse alix de stermaria my guest had written am so sorry am unfortunately prevented from dining with you this evening on the island in the bois had been so looking forward to it will write you a proper letter from stermaria very sorry kindest regards i stood motionless stunned by the shock that i had received at my feet lay the card and envelope fallen like the spent cartridge from a gun when the shot has been fired i picked them up tried to analyse her message she says that she cannot dine with me on the island in the bois one might gather from that that she would dine with me somewhere else i shall not be so indiscreet as to go and fetch her but after all that is quite a reasonable interpretation and from that island in the bois as for the last few days my thoughts had been installed there beforehand with mme de stermâria i could not succeed in bringing them back to where i was my desire responded automatically to the gravitational force which had been pulling it now for so many hours on end and in spite of this message too recent to counteract that force i went on instinctively getting ready to start just as a student although ploughed by the examiners tries to answer one question more at last i decided to tell françoise to go down and pay the driver i went along the passage without finding her i passed through the diningroom where suddenly my feet ceased to sound on the bare boards as they had been doing and were hushed to a silence which even before i had realised the explanation of it gave me a feeling of suffocation and confinement it was the carpets which in view of my parents return the servants had begun to put down again those carpets which look so well on bright mornings when amid their disorder the sun stays and waits for you like a friend come to take you out to luncheon in the country and casts over them the dappled light and shade of the forest but which now on the contrary were the first installation of the wintry prison from which obliged as i should be to live to take my meals at home i should no longer be free now to escape when i chose take care you do not slip sir they are not tacked yet françoise called to me i ought to have lighted up oh dear it is the end of sectember already the fine days are over in no time winter at the corner of a window as in a galle glass a vein of crusted snow and even in the champselysées instead of the girls one waits to see nothing but solitary sparrows what added to my distress at not seeing mme de stermâria was that her answer led me to suppose that whereas hour by hour since sunday i had been living for this dinner alone she had presumably never given it a second thought later on i learned of an absurd love match that she had suddenly made with a young man whom she must already have been seeing at this time and who had presumably made her forget my invitation for if she had remembered it she would surely never have waited for the carriage which i was not for that matter supposed to be sending for her to inform me that she was otherwise engaged my dreams of a young feudal maiden on a misty island had cleared the way to a still nonexistent love now my disappointment my rage my desperate desire to recapture her who had just refused me were able by bringing my sensibility into play to make definite the possible love which until then my imagination alone had and that more loosely offered me how many are there in our memories how many more have we forgotten of these faces of girls and young women all different to which we have added a certain charm and a frenzied desire to see them again only because at the last moment they eluded us in the case of mme de stermaria there was a good deal more than this and it was enough now to make me love her for me to see her again so that i might refresh those impressions so vivid but all too brief which my memory would not without such refreshment have the strength to keep alive when we were apart circumstances decided against me i did not see her again it was not she that i loved but it might well have been and one of the things that made most cruel perhaps the great love which was presently to come to me was that when i thought of this evening i used to say to myself that my love might given a slight modification of very ordinary circumstances have been directed elsewhere to mme de stermaria its application to her who inspired it in me so soon afterwards was not therefore as i so longed so needed to believe absolutely necessary and predestined françoise had left me by myself in the diningroom with the remark that it was foolish of me to stay there before she had lighted the fire she went to get me some dinner for even before the return of my parents from this very evening my seclusion was to begin i caught sight of a huge bundle of carpets still rolled up and leaning against one end of the sideboard and burying my head in it swallowing its dust with my own tears as the jews used to cover their heads with ashes in times of mourning i began to sob i shuddered not only because the room was cold but because a distinct lowering of temperature against the danger and i should add perhaps the by no means disagreeable sensation of which we make no attempt to react is brought about by a certain kind of tears which fall from our eyes drop by drop like a fine penetrating icy rain and seem as though never would they cease to flow suddenly i heard a voice may i come in françoise told me you would be in the diningroom i looked in to see whether you would care to come out and dine somewhere if it is not bad for your throat there is a fog outside you could cut with a knife it was arrived in paris that morning when i imagined him to be still in morocco or on the sea robert de saintloup i have already said as a matter of fact it was robert himself who at balbec had helped me quite without meaning it to arrive at this conclusion what i think about friendship to wit that it is so small a thing that i find it hard to understand how men with some claim to genius nietzsche for instance can have been such simpletons as to ascribe to it a certain intellectual value and consequently to deny themselves friendships in which intellectual esteem would have no part yes it has always been a surprise to me to find a man who carried sincerity towards himself to so high a pitch as to cut himself off by a scruple of conscience from wagners music imagining that the truth could ever be attained by the mode of expression naturally vague and inadequate which our actions in general and acts of friendship in particular furnish or that there could be any kind of significance in the fact of ones leaving ones work to go and see a friend and she would tears with him on hearing the false report that the louvre was burned i had got so far at balbec as to find that the pleasure of playing with a troop of girls is less destructive of the spiritual life to which at least it remains alien than friendship the whole effort of which is directed towards making us sacrifice the one real and save by the channel of art incommunicable part of ourself to a superficial self which finds not like the other any joy in itself but rather a vague sentimental attraction in the feeling that it is being supported by external props hospitably entertained by a strange personality through which happy in the protection that is afforded it there it makes its own comfort radiate in warm approval and marvels at qualities which it would denounce as faults and seek to correct in itself moreover the scorners of friendship can without illusion and not without remorse be the finest friends in the world just as an artist carrying in his brain a masterpiece and feeling that his duty is rather to live and carry on his work nevertheless so as not to be thought or to run the risk of actually being selfish gives his life for a vain because and gives it all the more gallantly in that the reasons for which he would have preferred not to give it were disinterested but whatever might be my opinion of friendship to mention only the pleasure that it procured me of a quality so mediocre as to be like something halfway between physical exhaustion and mental boredom there is no brew so deadly that it cannot at certain moments become precious and invigorating by giving us just the stimulus that was necessary the warmth that we cannot generate in ourselves the thought of course never entered my mind now of asking saintloup to take me as an hour earlier i had been longing to go to see some of the rivebelle women the scar left by my disappointment with mme de stermaria was too recent still to be so easily healed but at the moment when i had ceased to feel in my heart any reason for happiness saintloups bursting in upon me was like a sudden apparition of kindness mirth life which were external to me no doubt but offered themselves to me asked only to be made mine he did not himself understand my shout of gratitude my tears of affection and yet is there anything more unaccountably affecting than one of those friends be he diplomat explorer airman or soldier like saintloup who having to start next day for the country from where they will go on heaven knows where seem to form for themselves in the evening which they devote to us an impression which we are astonished both to find so rare and fleeting is it can be so pleasant to them and since it does so delight them not to see them prolong farther or repeat more often a meal with us an event so natural in itself affords these travellers the same strange and exquisite pleasure as our boulevards give to an asiatic we set off together to dine and as i went downstairs i thought of doncieres where every evening i used to meet robert at his restaurant and the little diningrooms there that i had forgotten i remembered one of these to which i had never given a thought and which was not in the hotel where saintloup dined but in another far humbler a cross between an inn and a boardinghouse where the waiting was done by the landlady and one of her servants i had been forced to take shelter there once from a snowstorm besides robert was not to be dining at the hotel that evening and i had not cared to go any farther my food was brought to me upstairs in a little room with bare wooden walls the lamp went out during dinner and the servant lighted a couple of candles i pretending that i could not see very well as i held out my plate while she helped me to potatoes took her bare forearm in my hand as though to guide her seeing that she did not withdraw it i began to fondle it then without saying a word pulled her bodily to me blew out the candles and told her to feel in my pocket for some money for the next few days physical pleasure seemed to me to require to be properly enjoyed not only this servant but the timbered diningroom so remote and lonely and yet it was to the other in which saintloup and his friends dined that i returned every evening from force of habit and in friendship for them until i left doncieres but even of this hotel where he took his meals with his friends i had long ceased to think we make little use of our experience we leave unconsumed in the summer dusk or precocious nights of winter the hours in which it had seemed to us that there might nevertheless be contained some element of tranquillity or pleasure but those hours are not altogether wasted when in their turn come and sing to us fresh moments of pleasure which by themselves would pass by equally bare in outline the others recur bringing with them the groundwork the solid consistency of a rich orchestration they are in this way prolonged into one of those types of happiness which we recapture only now and again but which continue to exist in the present instance the type was that of forsaking everything else to dine in comfortable surroundings which by the help of memory embody in a scene from nature suggestions of the rewards of travel with a friend who is going to stir our dormant life with all his energy his affection to communicate to us an emotional pleasure very different from anything that we could derive from our own efforts or from social distractions we are going to exist solely for him to utter vows of friendship which born within the confines of the hour remaining imprisoned in it will perhaps not be kept on the morrow but which i need have no scruple in taking before saintloup since with a courage into which there entered a great deal of common sense and the presentiment that friendship cannot explore its own depths on the morrow he would be gone if as i came downstairs i lived over again the evenings at doncieres when we reached the street in a moment the darkness now almost total in which the fog seemed to have put out the lamps which one could make out glimmering very faintly only when close at hand took me back to i could not say what arrival by night at combray when the streets there were still lighted only at long intervals and one felt ones way through a darkness moist warm consecrated like that of a christmas manger just visibly starred here and there by a wick that burned no brighter than a candle between that year to which i could ascribe no precise date of my combray life and the evenings at rivebelle which had an hour earlier been reflected above my drawn curtains what a world of differences i felt on perceiving them an enthusiasm which might have borne fruit had i been left alone and would then have saved me the unnecessary round of many wasted years through which i was yet to pass before there was revealed to me that invisible vocation of which these volumes are the history had the revelation come to me this evening the carriage in which i sat would have deserved to rank as more memorable with me than dr percepieds on the box seat of which i had composed that little sketch on which as it happened i had recently laid my hands altered it and sent it in vain to thefigaro of the spires of martinville is it because we live over our past years not in their continuous sequence day by day but in a memory that fastens upon the coolness or sunparched heat of some morning or afternoon receives the shadow of some solitary place is enclosed immovable arrested lost remote from all others because therefore the changes gradually wrought not only in the world outside but in our dreams and our evolving character changes which have imperceptibly carried us through life from one to another wholly different time are of necessity eliminated that if we revive another memory taken from a different year we find between the two thanks to lacunae to vast stretches of oblivion as it were the gulf of a difference in altitude or the incompatibility of two divers qualities that of the air we breathe and the colour of the scene before our eyes but between one and another of the memories that had now come to me in turn of combray of doncieres and of rivebelle i was conscious at the moment of more than a distance in time of the distance that there would be between two separate unis the material elements in which were not the same if i had sought to reproduce the element in which appeared carven my most trivial memories of rivebelle i should have had to streak with rosy veins to render at once translucent compact refreshing resonant a substance hitherto analogous to the coarse dark sandstone walls of combray but robert having finished giving his instructions to the driver joined me now in the carriage the ideas that had appeared before me took flight ideas are goddesses who deign at times to make themselves visible to a solitary mortal at a turning in the road even in his bedroom while he sleeps when they standing framed in the doorway bring him the annunciation of their tidings but as soon as a companion joins him they vanish in the society of his fellows no man has ever beheld them and i found myself cast back upon friendship when he first appeared robert had indeed warned me that there was a good deal of fog outside but while we were indoors talking it had grown steadily thicker it was no longer merely the light mist which i had looked forward to seeing rise from the island and envelop mme de stermaria and myself a few feet away from us the street lamps were blotted out and then it was night as dark as in the open fields in a forest or rather on a mild breton island whither i would fain have gone i lost myself as on the stark coast of some northern sea where one risks ones life twenty times over before coming to the solitary inn ceasing to be a mirage for which one seeks the fog became one of those dangers against which one has to fight so that we had in finding our way and reaching a safe haven the difficulties the anxiety and finally the joy which safety so little perceived by him who is not threatened with the loss of it gives to the perplexed and benighted traveller one thing only came near to destroying my pleasure during our adventurous ride owing to the angry astonishment into which it flung me for a moment you know i told bloch saintloup suddenly informed me that you did not really think all that of him that you found him rather vulgar at times i am like that you see i want people to know where they stand he wound up with a satisfied air and in a tone which brooked no reply i was astounded not only had i the most absolute confidence in saintloup in the loyalty of his friendship and he had betrayed it by what he had said to bloch but it seemed to me that he of all men ought to have been restrained from doing so by his defects as well as by his good qualities by that astonishing veneer of breeding which was capable of carrying politeness to what was positively a want of frankness his triumphant air was it what we assume to cloak a certain embarrassment in admitting a thing which we know that we ought not to have done or did it mean complete unconsciousness stupidity making a virtue out of a defect which i had not associated with him a passing fit of ill humour towards me prompting him to make an end of our friendship or the notation in words of a passing fit of ill humour in the company of bloch to whom he had felt that he must say something disagreeable even although i should be compromised by it however that might be his face was seared while he uttered this vulgar speech by a frightful sinuosity which i saw on it once or twice only in all the time i knew him and which beginning by running more or less down the middle of his face when it came to his lips twisted them gave them a hideous expression of baseness almost of bestiality quite transitory and no doubt inherited there must have been at such moments which recurred probably not more than once every other year a partial eclipse of his true self by the passage across it of the personality of some ancestor whose shadow fell on him fully as much as his satisfied air the words i want people to know where they stand encouraged the same doubt and should have incurred a similar condemnation i felt inclined to say to him that if one wants people to know where they stand one ought to confine these outbursts of frankness to ones own affairs and not to acquire a too easy merit at the expense of others but by this time the carriage had stopped outside the restaurant the huge front of which glazed and streaming with light alone succeeded in piercing the darkness the fog itself beside the comfortable brightness of the lighted interior seemed to be waiting outside on the pavement to shew one the way in with the joy of servants whose faces reflect the hospitable instincts of their master shot with the most delicate shades of light it pointed the way like the pillar of fire which guided the children of israel many of whom as it happened were to be found inside for this was the place to which bloch and his friends had long been in the habit maddened by a hunger as famishing as the ritual fast which at least occurs only once a year for coffee and the satisfaction of political curiosity of repairing in the evenings every mental excitement creating a value that overrides others a quality superior to the rest of ones habits there is no taste at all keenly developed that does not thus gather round it a society which it unites and in which the esteem of his fellows is what each of its members seeks before anything else from life here in their café be it in a little provincial town you will find impassioned musiclovers the greater part of their time all their spare cash is spent in chamberconcerts in meetings for musical discussion in cafés where one finds oneself among musical people and rubs shoulders with the members of the orchestra others keen upon flying seek to stand well with the old waiter in the glazed bar perched on top of the aerodrome sheltered from the wind as in the glass cage of a lighthouse they can follow in the company of an airman who is not going up that day the evolutions of a pilot practising loops while another invisible a moment ago comes suddenly swooping down to land with the great winged roar of an arabian roc the little group which met to try to perpetuate to explore the fugitive emotions aroused by the zola trial attached a similar importance to this particular café but they were not viewed with favour by the young nobles who composed the rest of its patrons and had taken possession of a second room separated from the other only by a flimsy parapet topped with a row of plants these looked upon dreyfus and his supporters as traitors albeit twentyfive years later ideas having had time to classify themselves and dreyfusism to acquire in the light of history a certain distinction the sons dancemad bolshevists of these same young nobles were to declare to the intellectuals who questioned them that undoubtedly had they been alive at the time they would have stood up for dreyfus without having any clearer idea of what the great case had been about than comtesse edmond de pourtales or the marquise de galliffet other luminaries already extinct at the date of their birth for on the night of the fog the noblemen of the café who were in due course to become the fathers of these young intellectuals dreyfusards in retrospect were still bachelors naturally the idea of a rich marriage was present in the minds of all their families but none of them had yet brought such a marriage off while still potential the only effect of this rich marriage the simultaneous ambition of several of them there were indeed several heiresses in view but after all the number of big dowries was considerably below that of the aspirants to them was to create among these young men a certain amount of rivalry as ill luck would have it saintloup remaining outside for a minute to explain to the driver that he was to call for us again after dinner i had to make my way in by myself in the first place once i had involved myself in the spinning door to which i was not accustomed i began to fear that i should never succeed in escaping from it let me note here for the benefit of lovers of verbal accuracy that the contrivance in question despite its peaceful appearance is known as a revolver from the english revolving door this evening the proprietor not venturing either to brave the elements outside or to desert his customers remained standing near the entrance so as to have the pleasure of listening to the joyful complaints of the new arrivals all aglow with the satisfaction of people who have had difficulty in reaching a place and have been afraid of losing their way the smiling cordiality of his welcome was however dissipated by the sight of a stranger incapable of disengaging himself from the rotating sheets of glass this flagrant sign of social ignorance made him knit his brows like an examiner who has a good mind not to utter the formula dignus est intrare as a crowning error i went to look for a seat in the room set apart for the nobility from which he at once expelled me indicating to me with a rudeness to which all the waiters at once conformed a place in the other room this was all the less to my liking because the seat was in the middle of a crowded row and i had opposite me the door reserved for the hebrews which as it did not revolve opening and shutting at every moment kept me in a horrible draught but the proprietor declined to move me saying no sir i cannot have the whole place upset for you presently however he forgot this belated and troublesome guest captivated as he was by the arrival of each newcomer who before calling for his beer his wing of cold chicken or his hot grog it was by now long past dinnertime must first as in the old romances pay his scot by relating his adventure at the moment of his entry into this asylum of warmth and security where the contrast with the perils just escaped made that gaiety and sense of comradeship prevail which create a cheerful harmony round the campfire one reported that his carriage thinking it had got to the pont de la concorde had circled three times round the invalides another that his in trying to make its way down the avenue des champselysées had driven into a clump of trees at the rond point from which it had taken him three quarters of an hour to get clear then followed lamentations upon the fog the cold the deathly stillness of the streets uttered and received with the same exceptionally jovial air which was accounted for by the pleasant atmosphere of the room which except where i sat was warm the dazzling light which set blinking eyes already accustomed to not seeing and the buzz of talk which restored their activity to deafened ears it was all the newcomers could do to keep silence the singularity of the mishaps which each of them thought unique burned their tongues and their eyes roved in search of some one to engage in conversation the proprietor himself lost all sense of social distinction m le prince de foix lost his way three times coming from the porte saintmartin he was not afraid to say with a laugh actually pointing out as though introducing one to the other the illustrious nobleman to an israelite barrister who on any evening but this would have been divided from him by a barrier far harder to surmount than the ledge of greenery three times fancy that said the barrister touching his hat this note of personal interest was not at all to the princes liking he formed one of an aristocratic group for whom the practice of impertinence even at the expense of their fellownobles when these were not of the very highest rank seemed the sole possible occupation not to acknowledge a bow and if the polite stranger repeated the offence to titter with sneering contempt or fling back ones head with a look of fury to pretend not to know some elderly man who might have done them a service to reserve their handclasp for dukes and the really intimate friends of dukes whom the latter introduced to them such was the attitude of these young men and especially of the prince de foix such an attitude was encouraged by the illbalanced mentality of early manhood a period in which even in the middle class one appears ungrateful and behaves like a cad because having forgotten for months to write to a benefactor after he has lost his wife one then ceases to nod to him in the street so as to simplify matters but it was inspired above all by an overacute caste snobbishness it is true that after the fashion of certain nervous affections the symptoms of which grow less pronounced in later life this snobbishness was on the whole to cease to express itself in so offensive a form in these men who had been so intolerable when young once youth is outgrown it is seldom that anyone remains hidebound by insolence he had supposed it to be the only thing in the world suddenly he discovers for all the prince that he is that there also are such things as music literature even standing for parliament the scale of human values is correspondingly altered and he joins in conversation with people whom at one time he would have slain with a glare of lightning which is fortunate for those of the latter who have had the patience to wait and whose character is sufficiently formed if one may so put it for them to feel pleasure in receiving in their forties the civility and welcome that had been coldly withheld from them at twenty as i have mentioned the prince de foix it may not be inconsequent here to add that he belonged to a set of a dozen or fifteen young men and to an inner group of four the dozen or fifteen shared this characteristic which the prince lacked i fancy that each of them faced the world in a dual aspect up to their own eyes in debt they were of no account in those of their tradesmen notwithstanding the pleasure these took in addressing them as monsieur le comte monsieur le marquis monsieur le duc they hoped to retrieve their fortunes by means of the famous rich marriage moneybags as the expression still was and as the fat dowries which they coveted numbered at the most four or five several of them would be silently training their batteries on the same damsel and the secret would be so well kept that when one of them on arriving at the café announced my dear fellows i am too fond of you all not to tell you of my engagement to mlle dambresac there was a general outburst more than one of the others imagining that the marriage was as good as settled already between mlle dambresac and himself and not having enough selfcontrol to stifle a spontaneous cry of stupefaction and rage so you like the idea of marriage do you bibi the prince de châtellerault could not help exclaiming letting his fork drop in his surprise and despair for he had been fully expecting the engagement of this identical mlle dambresac to be announced but with himself châtellerault as her bridegroom and heaven only knew all that his father had cunningly hinted to the ambresacs against bibis mother so you think it will be fun being married do you he was impelled to repeat his question to bibi who better prepared to meet it for he had had plenty of time to decide on the right attitude to adopt since the engagement had reached the semiofficial stage replied with a smile what pleases me is not the idea of marriage which never appealed much to me but marrying daisy dambresac whom i think charming in the time taken up by this response m de châtellerault had recovered his composure but he was thinking that he must at the earliest possible moment execute a change of front in the direction of mlle de la canourque or miss foster numbers two and three on the list of heiresses pacify somehow the creditors who were expecting the ambresac marriage and finally explain to the people to whom he too had declared that mlle dambresac was charming that this marriage was all very well for bibi but that he himself would have had all his family down on him like a ton of bricks if he had married her mme soléon he decided to say had actually announced that she would not have them in her house but if in the eyes of tradesmen proprietors of restaurants and the like they seemed of little account conly being creatures of dual personality the moment they appeared in society they ceased to be judged by the decay of their fortunes and the sordid occupations by which they sought to repair them they became once more m le prince this m le duc that and were reckoned only in terms of their quarterings a duke who was prac tically a multimillionaire and seemed to combine in his own person every possible distinction gave precedence to them because the heads of their various houses they were by descent sovereign princes of minute territories in which they were entitled to coin money and so forth often in this café one of them lowered his eyes when another came in so as not to oblige the newcomer to greet him this was because in his imaginative pursuit of riches he had invited a banker to dine every time that a man about town enters into relations on this footing with a banker the latter leaves him the poorer by a hundred thousand francs which does not prevent the man about town from at once repeating the process with another we continue to burn candles in churches and to consult doctors but the prince de foix who was rich already belonged not only to this fashionable set of fifteen or so young men but to a more exclusive and inseparable group of four which included saintloup these were never asked anywhere separately they were known as the four gigolos they were always to be seen riding together in country houses their hostesses gave them communicating bedrooms with the result that especially as they were all four extremely good looking rumours were current as to the extent of their intimacy i was in a position to give these the lie direct so far as saintloup was concerned but the curious thing is that if later on one was to learn that these rumours were true of all four each of the quartet had been entirely in the dark as to the other three and yet each of them had done his utmost to find out about the others to gratify a desire or more probably a resentment to prevent a marriage or to secure a hold over the friend whose secret he discovered a fifth for in these groups of four there are never four only had joined this platonic party who was more so than any of the others but religious scruples restrained him until long after the group had broken up and he himself was a married man the father of a family fervently praying at lourdes that the next baby might be a boy or a girl and spending the intervals of procreation in the pursuit of soldiers despite the princes code of manners the fact that the barristers comment though uttered in his hearing had not been directly addressed to him made him less angry than he would otherwise have been besides this evening was somewhat exceptional finally the barrister had no more prospect of coming to know the prince de foix than the cabman who had driven that noble lord to the restaurant the prince felt accordingly that he might allow himself to reply in an arrogant tone as though speaking to some one off stage to this stranger who thanks to the fog was in the position of a travelling companion whom one meets at some seaside place at the ends of the earth scoured by all the winds of heaven or shrouded in mist losing your ways nothing the trouble is you cannot find it again the wisdom of this aphorism impressed the proprietor for he had already heard it several times in the course of the evening he was in fact in the habit of always comparing what he heard or read with an already familiar canon and felt his admiration aroused if he could detect no difference this state of mind is by no means to be ignored for applied to political conversations to the reading of newspapers it forms public opinion and thereby makes possible the greatest events in history an aggregation of german landlords simply by being impressed by a customer or a newspaper when he or it said that france england and russia were out to crush germany made war at the time of agadir possible even if no war occurred historians if they have not been wrong to abandon the practice of attributing the actions of peoples to the will of kings ought to substitute for the latter the psychology of the person of no importance in politics the proprietor of this particular café had for some time now concentrated his pupilteachers mind on certain particular details of the dreyfus case if he did not find the terms that were familiar to him in the conversation of a customer or the columns of a newspaper he would pronounce the article boring or the speaker insincere the prince de foix however impressed him so forcibly that he barely gave him time to finish what he was saying that is right prince that is right which meant neither more nor less than repeated without a mistake that is exactly how it is he exclaimed expanding like people in the arabian nights to the limit of repletion but the prince had by this time vanished into the smaller room then as life resumes its normal course after even the most sensational happenings those who had emerged from the sea of fog began to order whatever they wanted to eat or drink among them a party of young men from the jockey club who in view of the abnormality of the situation had no hesitation in taking their places at a couple of tables in the big room and were thus quite close to me so the cataclysm had established even between the smaller room and the bigger among all these people stimulated by the comfort of the restaurant after their long wanderings across the ocean of fog a familiarity from which i alone was excluded not unlike the spirit that must have prevailed in noahs ark suddenly i saw the landlords body whipped into a series of bows the head waiters hurrying to support him in a full muster which drew every eye towards the door quick send cyprien here lay a table for m le marquis de saintloup cried the proprietor for whom robert was not merely a great nobleman possessing a real importance even in the eyes of the prince de foix but a client who drove through life fourinhand so to speak and spent a great deal of money in this restaurant the customers in the big room looked on with interest those in the small room shouted simultaneous greetings to their friend as he finished wiping his shoes but just as he was about to make his way into the small room he caught sight of me in the big one good god he exclaimed what on earth are you doing there and with the door wide open too he went on with an angry glance at the proprietor who ran to shut it throwing the blame on his staff i am always telling them to keep it shut i had been obliged to shift my own table and to disturb others which stood in the way in order to reach him why did you move would you sooner dine here than in the little room why my poor fellow you are freezing you will oblige me by keeping that door locked he turned to the proprietor this very instant m le marquis the gentlemen will have to go out of this room through the other that is all and the better to shew his zeal he detailed for this operation a head waiter and several satel lites vociferating the most terrible threats of punishment were it not properly carried out he began to shew me exaggerated marks of respect so as to make me forget that these had begun not upon my arrival but only after that of saintloup while lest i should think them to have been prompted by the friendliness shewn me by his rich and noble client he gave me now and again a surreptitious little smile which seemed to indicate a regard that was wholly personal something said by one of the diners behind me made me turn my head for a moment i had caught instead of the words wing of chicken excellent and a glass of champagne only not too dry the unexpected i should prefer glycerine yes hot excellent i wanted to see who the ascetic was that was inflicting upon himself such a diet i turned quickly back to saintloup so as not to be recognised by the man of strange appetite it was simply a doctor whom i happened to know and of whom another customer taking advantage of the fog to buttonhole him here in the café was asking his professional advice like stockbrokers doctors employ the first person singular meanwhile i was studying saintloup and my thoughts took a line of their own they were in this café i had myself known at other times plenty of foreigners intellectuals budding geniuses of all sorts resigned to the laughter excited by their pretentious capes their neckties and still more by the clumsiness of their movements going so far as to provoke that laughter in order to shew that they paid no heed to it who yet were men of real intellectual and moral worth of an extreme sensibility they repelled the jews among them principally the unassimilated jews that is to say for with the other kind we are not concerned those who could not endure any oddity or eccentricity of appearance as bloch repelled albertine generally speaking one realised afterwards that if they had against them hair worn too long noses and eyes that were too big stilted theatrical gestures it was puerile to judge them by these only they had plenty of intelligence and spirit and were men to whom in the long run one could become closely attached among the jews especially there were few whose parents and kinsfolk had not a warmth of heart a breadth of mind in comparison with which saintloups mother and the duc de guermantes cut the poorest of figures by their sereness their skindeep religiosity which denounced only the most open scandals their apology for a christianity which led invariably by the unexpected channel of a purely calculating mind to an enormously wealthy marriage but in saintloup when all was said however the faults of his relatives might be combined in a fresh creation of character there reigned the most charming openness of mind and heart and whenever it must be frankly admitted to the undying glory of france these qualities are found in a man who is purely french be he noble or plebeian they flower flourish would be too strong a word for a sense of proportion persists and also a certain restraint with a grace which the foreign visitor however estimable he may be does not present to us of these intellectual and moral qualities others undoubtedly have their share and if we have first to overcome what repels us and what makes us smile they remain no less precious but it is all the same a pleasant thing and one which is perhaps exclusively french that what is fine from the standpoint of equity what is of value to the heart and mind should be first of all attractive to the eyes charmingly coloured consummately chiselled should express outwardly as well in substance as in form an inward perfection i studied saintloups features and said to myself that it is a thing to be glad of when there is no lack of bodily grace to prepare one for the graces within and when the winged nostrils are spread as delicately and with as perfect a design as the wings of the little butterflies that hover over the fieldflowers round combray and that the true opus francigenum the secret of which was not lost in the thirteenth century the beauty of which would not be lost with the destruction of our churches consists not so much in the stone angels of saintandrédeschamps as in the young sons of france noble citizen or peasant whose faces are carved with that delicacy and boldness which have remained as traditional there as on the famous porch but are creative still as well after leaving us for a moment in order to supervise personally the barring of the door and the ordering of our dinner he laid great stress on our choosing butchers meat the fowls being presumably nothing to boast of the proprietor came back to inform us that m le prince de foix would esteem it a favour if m le marquis would allow him to dine at a table next to ours but they are all taken objected robert casting an eye over the tables which blocked the way to mine that does not matter in the least if m le marquis would like it i can easily ask these people to move to another table it is always a pleasure to do anything for m le marquis but you must decide said saintloup to me foix is a good fellow he may bore you or he may not anyhow he is not such a fool as most of them i told robert that of course i should like to meet his friend but that now that i was for once in a way dining with him and was so entirely happy i should be just as well pleased to have him all to myself he is got a very fine cloak the prince has the proprietor broke in upon our deliberation yes i know said saintloup i wanted to tell robert that m de charlus had disclaimed all knowledge of me to his sisterinlaw and to ask him what could be the reason of this but was prevented by the arrival of m de foix come to see whether his request had been favourably received we caught sight of him standing beside our table robert introduced us but did not hide from his friend that as we had things to talk about he would prefer not to be disturbed the prince withdrew adding to the farewell bow which he made me a smile which pointed at saintloup seemed to transfer to him the responsibility for the shortness of a meeting which the prince himself would have liked to see prolonged as he turned to go robert struck it appeared by a sudden idea dashed off after his friend with a stay where you are and get on with your dinner i shall be back in a moment to me and vanished into the smaller room i was pained to hear the smart young men sitting near me whom i did not know repeat the most absurd and malicious stories about the young hereditary grand duke of luxembourg formerly comte de nassau whom i had met at balbec and who had shewn me such delicate marks of sympathy at the time of my grandmothers illness according to one of these young me he had said to the duchesse de guermantes i expect everyone to get up when my wife passes to which the duchess had retorted with as little truth had she said any such thing as humour the grandmother of the young princess having always been the very pink of propriety get up when your wife passes do they well that is a change from her grandmothers day she expected the gentlemen to lie down then some one alleged that having gone down to see his aunt the princesse de luxembourg at balbec and put up at the grand hotel he had complained to the manager there my friend that the royal standard of luxembourg was not flown in front of the hotel over the sea and that this flag being less familiar and less generally in use than the british or italian it had taken him several days to procure one greatly to the young grand dukes annoyance i did not believe a word of this story but made up my mind as soon as i went to balbec to inquire of the manager so as to make certain that it was a pure invention while waiting for saintloup to return i asked the proprietor to get me some bread certainly monsieur le baron i am not a baron i told him oh beg pardon monsieur le comte i had no time to lodge a second protest which would certainly have promoted me to the rank of marquis faithful to his promise of an immediate return saintloup reappeared in the doorway carrying over his arm the thick vicuna cloak of the prince de foix from whom i guessed that he had borrowed it in order to keep me warm he signed to me not to get up and came towards me but either my table would have to be moved again or i must change my seat if he was to get to his entering the big room he sprang lightly on to one of the red plush benches which ran round its walls and on which apart from myself there were sitting only three or four of the young men from the jockey club friends of his own who had not managed to find places in the other room between the tables and the wall electric wires were stretched at a certain height without the least hesitation saintloup jumped nimbly over them like a horse in a steeplechase embarrassed that it should be done wholly for my benefit and to save me the trouble of a slight movement i was at the same time amazed at the precision with which my friend performed this exercise in lévitation and in this i was not alone for albeit they would probably have had but little admiration for a similar display on the part of a more humbly born and less generous client the proprietor and his staff stood fascinated like racegoers in the enclosure one underling apparently rooted to the ground stood there gaping with a dish in his hand for which a party close beside him were waiting and when saintloup having to get past his friends climbed on the narrow ledge behind them and ran along it balancing himself with his arms discreet applause broke from the body of the room on coming to where i was sitting he stopped short in his advance with the precision of a tributary chieftain before the throne of a sovereign and stooping down handed to me with an air of courtesy and submission the vicuna cloak which a moment later having taken his place beside me without my having to make a single movement he arranged as a light but warm shawl about my shoulders by the way while i think of it my uncle charlus has something to say to you i promised i would send you round to him tomorrow evening i was just going to speak to you about him but tomorrow evening i am dining with your aunt guermantes yes there is a regular beanfeast tomorrow at orianes i am not asked but my uncle palamede does not want you to go there you cannot get out of it i suppose well anyhow go on to my uncles afterwards i am sure he really does want to see you look here you can easily manage to get there by eleven eleven of the clock do not forget i will let him know he is very touchy if you do not turn up he will never forgive you and orianes parties are always over quite early if you are only going to dine there you can quite easily be at my uncles by eleven i ought really to go and see oriane about getting shifted from morocco i want an exchange she is so nice about all that sort of thing and she can get anything she likes out of general de saintjoseph who runs that branch but do not say anything about it to her i have mentioned it to the princesse de parme everything will be all right interesting place morocco i could tell you all sorts of things very fine lot of men out there one feels they are on ones own level mentally you do not think the germans are going to go to war about it no they are annoyed with us as after all they have every right to be but the emperor is out for peace they are always making us think they want war to force us to give in pure bluff you know like poker the prince of monaco one of wilhelms agents comes and tells us in confidence that germany will attack us then we give way but if we did not give way there would not be war in any shape or form you have only to think what a comic spectacle a war would be in these days it would be a bigger catastrophe than the flood and the götterdämmerung rolled in one only it would not last so long he spoke to me of friendship affection regret albeit like all visitors of his sort he was going off the next morning for some months which he was to spend in the country and would only be staying a couple of nights in paris on his way back to morocco or elsewhere but the words which he thus let fall into the heated furnace which my heart was this evening kindled a pleasant glow there our infrequent meetings this one in particular have since formed a distinct episode in my memories for him as for me this was the evening of friendship and yet the friendship that i felt for him at this moment was scarcely i feared and felt therefore some remorse at the thought what he would have liked to inspire filled still with the pleasure that i had had in seeing him come bounding towards me and gracefully pause on arriving at his goal i felt that this pleasure lay in my recognising that each of the series of movements which he had developed against the wall along the bench had its meaning its because in saintloups own personal nature possibly but even more in that which by birth and upbringing he had inherited from his race a certainty of taste in the region not of beauty but manners which when he was faced by a novel combination of circumstances enabled the man of breeding to grasp at once like a musician who has been asked to play a piece he has never seen the feeling the motions that were required and to apply the appropriate mechanism and technique which then allowed this taste to display itself without the constraint of any other consideration by which the average young man of the middle class would have been paralysed from fear as well of making himself ridiculous in the eyes of strangers by his disregard of convention as of appearing too deferential in the eyes of his friends the place of this constraint being taken in robert by a lofty disdain which certainly he had never felt in his heart but which he had received by inheritance in his body and which had moulded the attitudes of his ancestors to a familiarity with their inferiors which they imagined could only flatter and enchant those to whom it was displayed lastly a noble liberality which taking no account of his boundless natural advantages lavish expenditure in this restaurant had succeeded in making him here as elsewhere the most fashionable customer and the general favourite a position which was underlined by the deference shewn him throughout the place not only by the waiters but by all its most exclusive young patrons led him to trample them underfoot just as he had actually and symbolically trodden upon those benches decked with purple like a triumphal way which pleased my friend only because it enabled him more gracefully and swiftly to arrive at my side such were the qualities essential to aristocracy which through the husk of this body not opaque and vague as mine would have been but significant and limpid transmitted as through a work of art the industrious energetic force which had created it and rendered the movements of this lightfoot course which robert had pursued along the wall intelligible and charming as those of a row of knights upon a marble frieze alas robert might have thought was it worth while to have grown up despising birth honouring only justice and intellect choosing outside the ranks of the friends provided for me companions who were awkward and illdressed provided they had the gift of eloquence only for the sole personality apparent in me which is to remain a treasured memory to be not that which my will with the most praiseworthy effort has fashioned in my likeness but one which is not of my making which is not even myself which i have always disliked and striven to overcome was it worth while to love my chosen friend as i have loved him for the greatest pleasure that he can find in me to be that of discovering something far more general than myself a pleasure which is not in the least as he says though he cannot seriously believe it one of the pleasures of friendship but an intellectual and detached a sort of artistic pleasure this is what i am now afraid that saintloup may at times have thought if so he was mistaken if he had not as he steadfastly had cherished something more lofty than the suppleness innate in his body if he had not kept aloof for so long from the pride that goes with noble birth there would have been something more studied a certain heaviness in his very agility a selfimportant vulgarity in his manners as with mme de villeparisis a strong vein of seriousness had been necessary for her to give in her conversation and in her memoirs a sense of the frivolous which is intellectual so in order that saintloups body might be indwelt by so much nobility the latter had first to desert a mind that was aiming at higher things and reabsorbed into his body to be fixed there in unconscious noble lines in this way his distinction of mind was not absent from a bodily distinction which otherwise would not have been complete an artist has no need to express his mind directly in his work for it to express the quality of that mind it has indeed been said that the highest praise of god consists in the denial of him by the atheist who finds creation so perfect that it can dispense with a creator and i was quite well aware that it was not merely a work of art that i was admiring in this young man unfolding along the wall the frieze of his flying course the young prince a descendant of catherine de foix queen of navarre and granddaughter of charles vii whom he had just left for my sake the endowments by birth and fortune which he was laying at my feet the proud and shapely ancestors who survived in the assurance the agility the courtesy with which he now arranged about my shivering body the warm woollen cloak were not all these like friends of longer standing in his life by whom i might have expected that we should be permanently kept apart and whom on the contrary he was sacrificing to me by a choice which one can make only in the loftiest places of the mind with that sovereign liberty of which roberts movements were the presentment and in which is realised perfect friendship how much familiar intercourse with a guermantes in place of the distinction that it had in robert because there the inherited scorn of humanity was but the outer garment become an unconscious charm of a real moral humility could disclose of vulgar arrogance i had had an opportunity of seeing not in m de charlus in whom certain characteristic faults for which i had been unable so far to account were overlaid upon his aristocratic habits but in the duc de guermantes and yet he too in the general impression of commonness which had so strongly repelled my grandmother when she had met him once years earlier at mme de villeparisiss included glimpses of historic grandeur of which i became conscious when i went to dine in his house on the evening following that which i had spent with saintloup they had not been apparent to me either in himself or in the duchess when i had met them first in their aunts drawingroom any more than i had discerned on first seeing her the differences that set berma apart from her fellowplayers all the more that in her the individuality was infinitely more striking than in any social celebrity such distinctions becoming more marked in proportion as the objects are more real more conceivable by the intellect and yet however slight the shades of social distinction may be and so slight are they that when an accurate portrayer like saintebeuve tries to indicate the shades of difference between the salons of mme geoffrin mme récamier and mme de boigne they appear so much alike that the cardinal truth which unknown to the author emerges from his investigations is the vacuity of that form of life with them and for the same reason as with berma when the guermantes had ceased to impress me and the tiny drop of their originality was no longer vaporised by my imagination i was able to distil and analyse it imponderable as it was the duchess having made no reference to her husband when she talked to me at her aunts party i wondered whether in view of the rumours of a divorce that were current he would be present at the dinner but my doubts were speedily set at rest for through the crowd of footmen who stood about in the hall and who since they must until then have regarded me much as they regarded the children of the evicted cabinetmaker that is to say with more fellowfeeling perhaps than their master but as a person incapable of being admitted to his house must have been asking themselves to what this social revolution could be due i saw slip towards me m de guermantes himself who had been watching for my arrival so as to receive me upon his threshold and take off my greatcoat with his own hands mme de guermantes will be as pleased as punch he greeted me in a glibly persuasive tone let me help you off with your duds he felt it to be at once companionable and comic to employ the speech of the people my wife was just the least bit afraid you might fail us although you had fixed a date we have been saying to each other all day long depend upon it he will never turn up i am bound to say mme de guermantes was a better prophet than i was you are not an easy man to get hold of and i was quite sure you were going to play us false and the duke was so bad a husband so brutal even people said that one felt grateful to him as one feels grateful to wicked people for their occasional kindness of heart for those words mme de guermantes with which he appeared to be spreading out over the duchess a protecting wing that she might be but one flesh with him meanwhile taking me familiarly by the hand he began to lead the way to introduce me into his household just as some casual phrase may delight us coming from the lips of a peasant if it points to the survival of a local tradition shews the trace of some historic event unknown it may be to him who thus alludes to it so this politeness on the part of m de guermantes which moreover he was to continue to shew me throughout the evening charmed me as a survival of habits of many centuries growth habits of the seventeenth century in particular the people of bygone ages seem to us infinitely remote we do not feel justified in ascribing to them any underlying intention apart from those to which they give formal expression we are amazed when we come upon a sentiment more or less akin to what we are feeling today in a homeric hero or upon a skilful tactical feint in hannibal during the buttle of cannae where he let his flank be driven back in order to take the enemy by surprise and surround him it would seem that we imagined the epic poet and the punic general as being as remote from ourselves as an animal seen in a zoological garden even in certain personages of the court of louis xiv when we find signs of courtesy in the letters written by them to some man of inferior rank who could be of no service to them whatever they leave us bewildered because they reveal to us suddenly as existing among these great gentlemen a whole world of beliefs to which they never give any direct expression but which govern their conduct and especially the belief that they are bound in politeness to feign certain sentiments and to carry out with the most scrupulous care certain obligations of friendship this imagined remoteness of the past is perhaps one of the things that enable us to understand how even great writers have found an inspired beauty in the works of mediocre mystifiers such as macphersons ossian we so little expected to learn that bards long dead could have modern ideas that we marvel if in what we believe to be an ancient gaelic ode we come upon one which we should have thought at the most ingenious in a contemporary a translator of talent has simply to add to an ancient writer whom he presents to us more or less faithfully reproduced fragments which signed with a contemporary name and published separately would seem entertaining only at once he imparts a moving grandeur to his poet who is thus made to play upon the keyboards of several ages at once this translator was capable only of a mediocre book if that book had been published as his original work given out as a translation it seems that of a masterpiece the past not merely is not fugitive it remains present it is not within a few months only after the outbreak of a war that laws passed without haste can effectively influence its course it is not within fifteen years only after a crime which has remained obscure that a magistrate can still find the vital evidence which will throw a light on it after hundreds and thousands of years the scholar who has been studying in a distant land the placenames the customs of the inhabitants may still extract from them some legend long anterior to the christian era already unintelligible if not actually forgotten at the time of herodotus which in the name given to a rock in a religious rite dwells surrounded by the present like an emanation of greater density immemorial and stable there was similarly an emanation though far less ancient of the life of the court if not in the manners of m de guermantes which were often vulgar at least in the mind that controlled them i was to breathe this again like the odour of antiquity when i joined him a little later in the drawingroom for i did not go there at once as we left the outer hall i had mentioned to m de guermantes that i was extremely anxious to see his elstirs i am at your service is m elstir a friend of yours then if so it is most vexing for i know him slightly he is a pleasant fellow what our fathers used to call an honest fellow i might have asked him to honour us with his company and to dine tonight i am sure he would have been highly flattered at being invited to spend the evening in your society very little suggestive of the old order when he tried thus to assume its manner the duke relapsed unconsciously into it after inquiring whether i wished him to shew me the pictures he conducted me to them gracefully standing aside for me at each door apologising when to shew me the way he was obliged to precede me a little scene which since the days when saintsimon relates that an ancestor of the guermantes did him the honours of his town house with the same punctilious exactitude in the performance of the frivolous duties of a gentleman must before coming gradually down to us have been enacted by many other guermantes for numberless other visitors and as i had said to the duke that i would like very much to be left alone for a few minutes with the pictures he discreetly withdrew telling me that i should find him in the drawingroom when i was ready only once i was face to face with the elstirs i completely forgot about dinner and the time here again as at balbec i had before me fragments of that strangely coloured world which was no more than the projection the way of seeing things peculiar to that great painter which his speech in no way expressed the parts of the walls that were covered by paintings from his brush all homogeneous with one another were like the luminous images of a magic lantern which would have been in this instance the brain of the artist and the strangeness of which one could never have suspected so long as one had known only the man which was like seeing the iron lantern boxing its lamp before any coloured slide had been slid into its groove among these pictures several of the kind that seemed most absurd to ordinary people interested me more than the rest because they recreated those optical illusions which prove to us that we should never succeed in identifying objects if we did not make some process of reasoning intervene how often when driving in the dark do we not come upon a long lighted street which begins a few feet away from us when what we have actually before our eyes is nothing but a rectangular patch of wall with a bright light falling on it which has given us the mirage of depth in view of which is it not logical not by any artifice of symbolism but by a sincere return to the very root of the impression to represent one thing by that other for which in the flash of a first illusion we mistook it surfaces and volumes are in reality independent of the names of objects which our memory imposes on them after we have recognised them elstir attempted to wrest from what he had just felt what he already knew his effort had often been to break up that aggregate of impressions which we call vision the people who detested these horrors were astonished to find that elstir admired chardin perroneau any number of painters whom they the ordinary men and women of society liked they did not take into account that elstir had had to make for his own part in striving to reproduce reality with the particular index of his taste for certain lines of approach the same effort as a chardin or a perroneau and that consequently when he ceased to work for himself he admired in them attempts of the same order fragments anticipatory so to speak of works of his own nor did these society people include in their conception of elstirs work that temporal perspective which enabled them to like or at least to look without discomfort at chardins painting and yet the older among them might have reminded themselves that in the course of their lives they had seen gradually as the years bore them away from it the unbridgeable gulf between what they considered a masterpiece by ingres and what they had supposed must remain for ever a horror manetsolympia for example shrink until the two canvases seemed like twins but we learn nothing from any lesson because we have not the wisdom to work backwards from the particular to the general and imagine ourselves always to be going through an experience which is without precedents in the past i was moved by the discovery in two of the pictures more realistic these and in an earlier manner of the same person in one in evening dress in his own drawingroom in the other wearing a frock coat and tall hat at some popular regatta where he had evidently no business to be which proved that for elstir he was not only a regular sitter but a friend perhaps a patron whom it pleased him just as carpaccio used to introduce prominent figures and in speaking likenesses from contemporary life in venice to introduce into his pictures just as beethoven too found pleasure in inscribing at the top of a favourite work the beloved name of the archduke rudolph there was something enchanting about this waterside carnival the river the womens dresses the sails of the boats the innumerable reflexions of one thing and another came crowding into this little square panel of beauty which elstir had cut out of a marvellous afternoon what delighted one in the dress of a woman who had stopped for a moment in the dance because it was hot and she was out of breath was irresistible also in the same way in the canvas of a motionless sail in the water of the little harbour in the wooden bridge in the leaves of the trees and in the sky as in one of the pictures that i had seen at balbec the hospital as beautiful beneath its sky of lapis lazuli as the cathedral itself seemed more bold than elstir the theorician then elstir the man of taste the lover of things mediaeval to be intoning there is no such thing as gothic there is no such thing as a masterpiece this tasteless hospital is just as good as the glorious porch so i now heard the slightly vulgar lady at whom a man of discernment would refrain from glancing as he passed her by would except from the poetical composition which nature has set before him her dress is receiving the same light as the sail of that boat and there are no degrees of value and beauty the commonplace dress and the sail beautiful in itself are two mirrors reflecting the same gleam the value is all in the painters eye this eye had had the skill to arrest for all time the motion of the hours at this luminous instant when the lady had felt hot and had stopped dancing when the tree was fringed with a belt of shadow when the sails seemed to be slipping over a golden glaze but just because the depicted moment pressed on one with so much force this so permanent canvas gave one the most fleeting impression one felt that the lady would presently move out of it the boats drift away the night draw on that pleasure comes to an end that life passes and that the moments illuminated by the convergence at once of so many lights do not recur i recognized yet another aspect quite different it is true of what the moment means in a series of watercolours of mythological subjects dating from elstirs first period which also adorned this room society people who held advanced views on art went as far as this earliest manner but no further these were certainly not the best work that he had done but already the sincerity with which the subject had been thought out melted its natural coldness thus the muses for instance were represented as it might be creatures belonging to a species now fossilised but creatures which it would not have been surprising in mythological times to see pass in the evening in twos or threes along some mountain path here and there a poet of a race that had also a peculiar interest for the zoologist characterised by a certain sexlessness strolled with a muse as one sees in nature creatures of different but of kindred species consort together in one of these watercolours one saw a poet wearied by long wanderings on the mountains whom a centaur meeting him and moved to pity by his weakness had taken on his back and was carrying home in more than one other the vast landscape in which the mythical scene the fabulous heroes occupied a minute place and were almost lost was rendered from the mountain tops to the sea with an exactitude which told one more than the hour told one to the very minute what time of day ft was thanks to the precise angle of the setting sun to the fleeting fidelity of the shadows in this way the artist managed to give by making it instantaneous a sort of historical reality as of a thing actually lived to the symbol of his fable painted it and set it at a definite point in the past while i was examining elstirs paintings the bell rung by arriving guests had been pealing uninterruptedly and had lulled me into a pleasing unconsciousness but the silence which followed its clangour and had already lasted for some time succeeded less rapidly it is true in awakening me from my dream as the silence that follows lindors music arouses bartolo from his sleep i was afraid that i had been forgotten that they had sat down to dinner and hurried to the drawingroom at the door of the elstir gallery i found a servant waiting for me whitehaired though whether with age or powder i cannot say with the air of a spanish minister but treating me with the same respect that he would have shewn to a king i felt from his manner that he must have been waiting for at least an hour and i thought with alarm of the delay i had caused in the service of dinner especially as i had promised to be at m de charluss by eleven the spanish minister though i also met on the way the footman persecuted by the porter who radiant with delight when i inquired after his girl told me that the very next day they were both to be off duty so that he would be able to spend the whole day with her and extolled the generosity of madame la duchesse conducted me to the drawingroom where i was afraid of finding m de guermantes in an ill humour he welcomed me on the contrary with a joy that was evidently to a certain extent artificial and dictated by politeness but was also sincere prompted both by his stomach which so long a delay had begun to famish and his consciousness of a similar impatience in all his other guests who completely filled the room indeed i heard afterwards that i had kept them waiting for nearly threequarters of an hour the duc de guermantes probably thought that to prolong the general torment for two minutes more would not intensify it and that politeness having driven him to postpone for so long the moment of moving into the diningroom this politeness would be more complete if by not having dinner announced immediately he could succeed in persuading me that i was not late and that they had not been waiting for me and so he asked me as if we had still an hour before dinner and some of the party had not yet arrived what i thought of his elstirs but at the same time and without letting the cravings of his stomach become apparent so as not to lose another moment he in concert with the duchess proceeded to the ceremony of introduction then only i perceived that there had occurred round about me me who until this evening save for my novitiate in mme swanns drawingroom had been accustomed in my mothers homes at combray and in paris to the manners either protecting or defensive of the grim ladies of our middleworld who treated me as a child a change of surroundings comparable to that which introduces parsifal suddenly into the midst of the flowermaidens those who surrounded me now their bosoms entirely bare the naked flesh appeared on either side of a sinuous spray of mimosa or behind the broad petals of a rose could not murmur a word of greeting without at the same time bathing me in long caressing glances as though shyness alone restrained them from kissing me many of them were nevertheless highly respectable from the moral standpoint many not all for the most virtuous had not for those of a lighter vein the same repulsion that my mother would have felt the caprices of ones conduct denied by saintlier friends in the face of the evidence seemed in the guermantes world to matter far less than the relations which one had been able to maintain one pretended not to know that the body of ones hostess was at the disposal of all comers provided that her visiting list showed no gaps as the duke put himself out not at all for his other guests of whom he had long known everything that there was to know and they of him but quite markedly for me whose kind of superiority being outside his experience inspired in him something akin to the respect which the great nobleman of the court of louis xiv used to feel for his plebeian ministers he evidently considered that the fact of my not knowing his other guests mattered not at all to me at least though it might to them and while i was anxious on his account as to the impression that i was going to make on them he was thinking only of how his friends would impress me at the very outset i found myself completely bewildered no sooner had i entered the drawingroom than m de guermantes without even allowing me time to shake hands with the duchess had led me as though i were a delightful surprise to the person in question to whom he seemed to be saying here is your friend you see i am bringing him to you by the scruff of his neck towards a lady of smallish stature whereupon long before thrust forward by the duke i had reached her chair the lady had begun to flash at me continuously from her large soft dark eyes the thousand smiles of understanding which we address to an old friend who perhaps has not recognised us as this was precisely my case and i could not succeed in calling to mind who she was i averted my eyes from her as i approached so as not to have to respond until our introduction should have released me from my predicament meanwhile the lady continued to maintain in unstable equilibrium the smile intended for myself she looked as though she were anxious to be relieved of it and to hear me say oh but this is a pleasure mamma will be pleased when i tell her i have met you i was as impatient to learn her name as she was to see that i did finally greet her fully aware of what i was doing so that the smile which she was holding on indefinitely like the note of a tuningfork might at length be let go but m de guermantes managed things so badly to my mind at least that i seemed to have heard only my own name uttered and was given no clue to the identity of my unknown friend to whom it never occurred to tell me herself what her name was so obvious did the grounds of our intimacy which baffled me completely seem to her indeed as soon as i had come within reach she did not offer me her hand but took mine in a familiar clasp and spoke to me exactly as though i had been equally conscious with herself of the pleasant memories to which her mind reverted she told me how sorry albert who i gathered was her son would be to have missed seeing me i tried to remember who among the people i had known as boys was called albert and could think only of bloch but this could not be blochs mother that i saw before me since she had been dead for some time in vain i struggled to identify the past experience common to herself and me to which her thoughts had been carried back but i could no more distinguish it through the translucent jet of her large soft pupils which allowed only her smile to pierce their surface than one can distinguish a landscape that lies on the other side of a smoked glass even when the sun is blazing on it she asked me whether my father was not working too hard if i would not come to the theatre some evening with albert if i was stronger now and as my replies stumbling through the mental darkness in which i was plunged became distinct only to explain that i was not feeling well that evening she pushed forward a chair for me herself going to all sorts of trouble which i was not accustomed to see taken by my parents friends at length the clue to the riddle was furnished me by the duke she thinks you are charming he murmured in my ear which felt somehow that it had heard these words before they were what mme de villeparisis had said to my grandmother and myself after we had made the acquaintance of the princesse de luxembourg everything became clear the lady i now saw had nothing in common with mme de luxembourg but from the language of him who thus served me with her i could discern the nature of the animal it was a royalty she had never before heard of either my family or myself but a scion of the noblest race and endowed with the greatest fortune in the world for a daughter of the prince de parme she had married a cousin of equal princelihood she sought always in gratitude to her creator to testify to her neighbour however poor or lowly he might be that she did not look down upon him really i might have guessed this from her smile i had seen the princesse de luxembourg buy little ryecakes on the beach at balbec to give to my grandmother as though to a caged deer in the zoological garden but this was only the second princess of the blood royal to whom i had been presented and i might be excused my failure to discern in her the common factors of the friendliness of the great besides had not they themselves gone out of their way to warn me not to count too much on this friendliness since the duchesse de guermantes who had waved me so effusive a greeting with her gloved hand at the opéracomique had appeared furious when i bowed to her in the street like people who having once given somebody a sovereign feel that this has set them free from any further obligation toward him as for m de charlus his ups and downs were even more sharply contrasted while in the sequel i have known as the reader will learn highnesses and majesties of another sort altogether queens who play the queen and speak not after the conventions of their kind but like the queens in sardous plays if m de guermantes had been in such haste to present me it was because the presence at a party of anyone not personally known to a royal personage is an intolerable state of things which must not be prolonged for a single instant it was similar to the haste which saintloup had shewn in making me introduce him to my grandmother by the same token by a fragmentary survival of the old life of the court which is called social courtesy and is not superficial in which rather by a centripetal reversion it is the surface that becomes essential and profound the due and duchesse de guermantes regarded as a duty more essential than those which one at least of the pair neglected often enough of charity chastity pity and justice as a more unalterable law that of never addressing the princesse de parme save in the third person having never yet in my life been to parma a pilgrimage i had been anxious to make ever since certain easter holidays long ago to meet its princess who i knew owned the finest palace in that matchless city where moreover everything must be in keeping isolated as it was from the rest of the world within the polished walls in the atmosphere stifling as a breathless summer evening on the piazza of a small town in italy of its compact and almost cloying name would surely have substituted in a flash for what i had so often tried to imagine all that did really exist at parma in a sort of partial arrival there without my having to stir from paris of myself it was in the algebraical expression of a journey to the city of correggio a simple equation so to speak of that unknown quantity but if i had for many years past like a perfumer impregnating a solid mass of grease with scent made this name princesse de parme absorb the fragrance of thousands of violets in return when i set eyes on the princess who until then i should have sworn must be the sanseverina herself a second process began which was not i may say completed until several months had passed and consisted in expelling by means of fresh chemical combinations all the essential oil of violets and all the stendhalian fragrance from the name of the princess and in implanting there in their place the image of a little dark woman taken up with good works of a friendliness so humble that one felt at once in how exalted a pride that friendliness had its roots moreover while barring a few points of difference she was exactly like any other great lady she was as little stendhalian as is for example in paris in the europe quarter the rue de parme which bears far less resemblance to the name of parma than to any or all of the neighbouring streets and reminds one not nearly so much of the charterhouse in which fabrice ends his days as of the waiting room in the saintlazare station her friendliness sprang from two causes the first and more general was the education which this daughter of kings had received her mother not merely allied by blood to all the royal families of europe but furthermore in contrast to the ducal house of parma richer than any reigning princess had instilled into her from her earliest childhood the arrogantly humble precepts of an evangelical snobbery and today every line of the daughters face the curve of her shoulders the movements of her arms seemed to repeat the lesson remember that if god has caused you to be born on the steps of a throne you ought not to make that a reason for looking down upon those to whom divine providence has willed wherefore his name be praised that you should be superior by birth and fortune on the contrary you must suffer the little ones your ancestors were princes of treves and juliers from the year god has decreed in his bounty that you should hold practically all the shares in the suez canal and three times as many royal dutch as edmond de rothschild your pedigree in a direct line has been established by genealogists from the year of the christian era you have as sistersinlaw two empresses therefore never seem in your speech to be recalling these great privileges not that they are precarious for nothing can alter antiquity of race while the world will always need petrol but because it is useless to point out that you are better born than other people or that your investments are all giltedged since everyone knows these facts already be helpful to the needy furnish to all those whom the bounty of heaven has done you the favour of placing beneath you as much as you can give them without forfeiture of your rank that is to say help in the form of money even your personal service by their sickbeds but never bear well in mind invite them to your parties which would do them no possible good and by weakening your own position would diminish the efficacy of your benevolent activities and so even at the moments when she could not do good the princess endeavoured to shew or rather to let it be thought by all the external signs of dumb language that she did not consider herself superior to the people among whom she found herself thrown she treated each of them with that charming courtesy with which wellbred people treat their inferiors and was continually to make herself useful pushing back her chair so as to leave more room holding my gloves offering me all those services which would demean the proud spirit of a commoner but are very willingly rendered by sovereign ladies or instinctively and by force of professional habit by retired servants but already the duke who seemed in a hurry to complete the round of introduction had led me off to another of the flowermaidens on hearing her name i told her that i had passed by her country house not far from balbec oh i should have been so pleased to take you over it she informed me almost in a whisper to enhance her modesty but in a tone of deep feeling steeped in regret for the loss of an opportunity to enjoy a quite exceptional pleasure and went on with a meaning glance i do hope you will come again some day but i must say that what would interest you more still would be my aunt brancass place it was built by mansard it is the jewel of the province it was not only she herself who would have been glad to shew me over her house but her aunt brancas would have been no less delighted to do me the honours of hers or so i was assured by this lady who thought evidently that especially at a time when the land shewed a tendency to pass into the hands of financiers who had no knowledge of the world it was important that the great should keep up the exalted traditions of lordly hospitality by speeches which involved them in nothing it was also because she sought like everyone in her world to say the things which would give most pleasure to the person she was addressing to give him the highest idea of himself to make him think that he flattered people by writing to them that he honoured those who entertained him that everyone was burning to know him the desire to give other people this comforting idea of themselves does it must be admitted exist even among the middle classes we find there that kindly disposition in the form of an individual merit compensating for some other defect not alas among the most trusty male friends but at any rate among the most agreeable female companions but there anyhow it blooms only in isolated patches in an important section of the aristocracy on the other hand this characteristic has ceased to be individual cultivated by education sustained by the idea of a personal greatness which can fear no humiliation which knows no rival is aware that by being pleasant it can make people happy and delights in doing so it has become the generic feature of a class and even those whom personal defects of too incompatible a kind prevent from keeping it in their hearts bear the unconscious trace of it in their vocabulary or their gesticulation she is a very good creature said the duc de guermantes of the princesse de parme and she can play the great lady when she likes better than anyone while i was being introduced to the ladies one of the gentlemen of the party had been shewing various signs of agitation this was comte hannibal de bréautéconsalvi arriving late he had not had time to investigate the composition of the party and when i entered the room seeing in me a guest who was not one of the duchesss regular circle and must therefore have some quite extraordinary claim to admission installed his monocle beneath the groined arch of his eyebrow thinking that this would be a great help to him in discovering what manner of man i was he knew that mme de guermantes possessed the priceless appanage of truly superior women what was called a salon that is to say added occasionally to the people of her own set some celebrity who had recently come into prominence by the discovery of a new cure for something or the production of a masterpiece the faubourg saintgermain had not yet recovered from the shock of learning that to the reception which she had given to meet the king and queen of england the duchess had not been afraid to invite m détaille the clever women of the faubourg who had not been invited were inconsolable so deliciously thrilling would it have been to come into contact with that strange genius mme de courvoisier made out that m ribot had been there as well but this was a pure invention designed to make people believe that oriane was aiming at an embassy for her husband finally a last straw of scandal m de guermantes with a gallantry that would have done credit to marshal saxe had repaired to the greenroom of the comédie française and had begged mlle reichemberg to come and recite before the king which having come to pass constituted an event without precedent in the annals of routs remembering all these surprises which moreover had his entire approval his own presence being not merely an ornament but in the same way as that of the duchesse de guermantes a consecration to any drawingroom m de bréauté when he asked himself who i could be felt that the field of exploration was very wide for a moment the name of m widor flashed before his mind but he decided that i was not old enough to be an organist and m widor not striking enough to be asked out it seemed on the whole more plausible to regard me simply as the new attaché at the swedish legation of whom he had heard and he was preparing to ask me for the latest news of oscar by whom he had several times been very hospitably received but when the duke in introducing me had mentioned my name to m de bréauté the latter finding that name to be completely unknown to him had no longer any doubt that being where i was i must be a celebrity of some sort oriane would certainly never invite anyone who was not and had the art of attracting men who were in the public eye to her house in a ratio that of course never exceeded one per cent otherwise she would have lowered its tone m de bréauté began therefore to lick his chops and to sniff the air greedily his appetite whetted not only by the good dinner upon which he could count but by the character of the party which my presence could not fail to make interesting and which would furnish him with a topic for brilliant conversation next day at the duc de chartress luncheontable he had not yet settled in his own mind whether i was the man who had just been making those experiments with a serum to cure cancer or the author of the new curtainraiser then in rehearsal at the théâtre français but a great intellectual a great collector of travellers tales he continued an ever increasing display of reverences signs of mutual understanding smiles filtered through the glass of his monocle either in the mistaken idea that a man of my standing would esteem him more highly if he could manage to instil into me the illusion that for him the comte de bréautéconsalvi the privileges of the mind were no less deserving of respect than those of birth or simply from the need to express and difficulty of expressing his satisfaction in his ignorance of the language in which he ought to address me just as if in fact he had found himself face to face with one of the natives of an undiscovered country on which his keel had grounded natives from whom in the hope of ultimate profit he would endeavour observing with interest the while their quaint customs and without interrupting his demonstrations of friendship or like them uttering loud cries to obtain ostrich eggs and spices in exchange for his glass beads having responded as best i could to his joy i shook hands next with the duc de chatellerault whom i had already met at mme de villeparisiss who he informed me was as cunning as they made them he was typically guermantes in the fairness of his hair his arched profile the points where the skin of his cheeks lost colour all of which may be seen in the portraits of that family which have come down to us from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries but as i was no longer in love with the duchess her reincarnation in the person of a young man offered me no attraction i interpreted the hook made by the duc de chatelleraults nose as if it had been the signature of a painter whose work i had long studied but who no longer interested me in the least next i said good evening also to the prince de foix and to the detriment of my knuckles which emerged crushed and mangled let them be caught in a vice which was the german handclasp accompanied by an ironical or goodnatured smile of the prince von faffenheim m de norpoiss friend who by virtue of the mania for nicknames which prevailed in this set was known so universally as prince von that he himself used to sign his letters prince von or when he wrote to his intimates von and yet this abbreviation was understandable in view of his triplebarrelled name it was less easy to grasp the reasons which made elizabeth be replaced now by lili now by bebeth just as another world swarmed with kikis one can realise that these people albeit in most respects idle and lightminded enough might have come to adopt quiou in order not to waste the precious time that it would have taken them to pronounce montesquieu but it is not so easy to see what they saved by naming one of their cousins dinand instead of ferdinand it must not be thought however that in the invention of nicknames the guermantes invariably proceed to curtail or reduplicate syllables thus two sisters the comtesse de montpeyroux and the vicomtesse de vélude who were both of them enormously stout invariably heard themselves addressed without the least trace of annoyance on their part or of amusement on other peoples so long established was the custom as petite and mignonne mme de guermantes who adored mme de montpeyroux would if her friend had been seriously ill have flown to the sister with tears in her eyes and exclaimed i hear petite is dreadfully bad mme de leclin who wore her hair in bands that entirely hid her ears was never called anything but the empty stomach in some cases people simply added an a to the last or first name of the husband to indicate the wife the most miserly most sordid most inhuman man in the faubourg having been christened raphael his charmer his flower springing also from the rock always signed herself raphaela but these are merely a few specimens taken from innumerable rules to which we can always return later on if the occasion offers and explain some of them i then asked the duke to present me to the prince dagrigente what do you mean to say you do not know our excellent grigri cried m de guermantes and gave m dagrigente my name his own so often quoted by françoise had always appeared to me like a transparent sheet of coloured glass through which i beheld struck on the shore of the violet sea by the slanting rays of a golden sun the rosy marble cubes of an ancient city of which i had not the least doubt that the prince happening for a miraculous moment to be passing through paris was himself as luminously sicilian and gloriously mellowed the absolute sovereign alas the vulgar drone to whom i was introduced and who wheeled round to bid me good evening with a ponderous ease which he considered elegant was as independent of his name as of any work of art that he might have owned without bearing upon his person any trace of its beauty without perhaps ever having stopped to examine it the prince dagrigente was so entirely devoid of anything princely anything that might make one think of girgenti that one was led to suppose that his name entirely distinct from himself bound by no ties to his person had had the power of attracting to itself the whole of whatever vague poetical element there might have been in this man as in any other and isolating it after the operation in the enchanted syllables if any such operation had been performed it had certainly been done most efficiently for there remained not an atom of charm to be drawn from this kinsman of guermantes with the result that he found himself at one and the same time the only man in the world who was prince dagrigente and the man who of all the men in the world was perhaps least so he was for all that very glad to be what he was but as a banker is glad to hold a number of shares in a mine without caring whether the said mine answers to the charming name of ivanhoe or primrose or is called merely the premier meanwhile as these introductions which it has taken me so long to recount but which beginning as i entered the room had lasted only a few seconds were coming to an end and mme de guermantes in an almost suppliant tone was saying to me i am sure basin is tiring you dragging you round like that we are anxious for you to know our friends but we are a great deal more anxious not to tire you so that you may come again often the duke with a somewhat awkward and timid wave of the hand gave as he would gladly have given it at any time during the last hour filled for me by the contemplation of his elstirs the signal that dinner might now be served i should add that one of the guests was still missing m de grouchy whose wife a guermantes by birth had arrived by herself her husband being due to come straight from the country where he had been shooting all day this m de grouchy a descendant of his namesake of the first empire of whom it has been said quite wrongly that his absence at the start of the battle of waterloo was the principal because of napoleons defeat came of an excellent family which however was not good enough in the eyes of certain fanatics for blue blood thus the prince de guermantes whose own tastes in later life were to prove more easily satisfied had been in the habit of saying to his nieces what a misfortune for that poor mme de guermantes the vicomtesse de guermantes mme de grouchys mother that she has never succeeded in marrying any of her children but uncle the eldest girl married m de grouchy i do not call that a husband however they say that your uncle françois has proposed for the youngest one so perhaps they will not all die old maids no sooner was the order to serve dinner given than with a vast gyratory whirr multiple and simultaneous the double doors of the diningroom swung apart a chamberlain with the air of a lord chamberlain bowed before the princesse de parme and announced the tidings madame is served in a tone such as he would have employed to say madame is dead which however cast no gloom over the assembly for it was with an air of unrestrained gaiety and as in summer at robinson that the couples moved forward one behind another to the diningroom separating when they had reached their places where footmen thrust their chairs in behind them last of all mme de guermantes advanced upon me that i might lead her to the table and without my feeling the least shadow of the timidity that i might have feared for like a huntress to whom her great muscular prowess has made graceful motion an easy thing observing no doubt that i had placed myself on the wrong side of her she pivoted with such accuracy round me that i found her arm resting on mine and attuned in the most natural way to a rhythm of precise and noble movements i yielded to these with all the more readiness in that the guermantes attached no more importance to them than does to learning a truly learned man in whose company one is less alarmed than in that of a dunce other doors opened through which there entered the steaming soup as though the dinner were being held in a puppettheatre of skilful mechanism where the belated arrival of the young guest set on a signal from the puppetmaster all the machinery in motion timid and not majestically sovereign had been this signal from the duke to which had responded the unlocking of that vast ingenious subservient and sumptuous clockwork mechanical and human the indecision of his gesture did not spoil for me the effect of the spectacle that was attendant upon it for i could feel that what had made it hesitating and embarrassed was the fear of letting me see that they were waiting only for myself to begin dinner and that they had been waiting for some time just as mme de guermantes was afraid that after looking at so many pictures i would find it tiring and would be hindered from taking my ease among them if her husband engaged me in a continuous flow of introductions so that it was the absence of grandeur in this gesture that disclosed its true grandeur as also did that indifference shewn by the duke to the splendour of his surroundings in contrast to his deference towards a guest however insignificant whom he desired to honour not that m de guermantes was not in certain respects thoroughly commonplace shewing indeed some of the absurd weaknesses of a man with too much money the arrogance of an upstart which he certainly was not but just as a public official or a priest sees his own humble talents multiplied to infinity as a wave is by the whole mass of the sea which presses behind it by those forces on which they can rely the government of france and the catholic church so m de guermantes was borne on by that other force aristocratic courtesy in its truest form this courtesy drew the line at any number of people mme de guermantes would not have asked to her house mme de cambremer or m de forcheville but the moment that anyone as was the case with me appeared eligible for admission into the guermantes world this courtesy revealed treasures of hospitable simplicity more splendid still were that possible than those historic rooms or the marvellous furniture that had remained in them when he wished to give pleasure to anyone m de guermantes possessed in this way for making his guest for the moment the principal person present an art which made the most of the circumstances and the place no doubt at guermantes his distinctions and favours would have assumed another form he would have ordered his carriage to take me for a drive alone with himself before dinner such as they were one could not help feeling touched by his manners as one is in reading memoirs of the period by those of louis xiv when he replies goodnaturedly smiling and almost with a bow to some one who has come to solicit his favour it must however in both instances be borne in mind that this politeness did not go beyond the strict meaning of the word louis xiv with whom the sticklers for pure nobility of his day find fault nevertheless for his scant regard for etiquette so much so that according to saintsimon he was only a very minor king as kings go when compared with such monarchs as philippe de valois or charles v has the most minute instructions drawn up so that princes of the blood and ambassadors may know to what sovereigns they ought to give precedence in certain cases in view of the impossibility of arriving at a decision a compromise is arranged by which the son of louis xiv monseigneur shall entertain certain foreign sovereigns only out of doors in the open air so that it may not be said that in entering the house one has preceded the other and the elector palatine entertaining the duc de chevreuse at dinner pretends so as not to have to make way for his guest to be taken ill and dines with him indeed but dines lying down thus avoiding the difficulty m le duc evading opportunities of paying his duty to monsieur the latter on the advice of the king his brother who is moreover extremely attached to him seizes an excuse for making his cousin attend his levee and forcing him to pass him his shirt but as soon as the feeling is deep when the heart is involved this rule of duty so inflexible when politeness only is at stake changes entirely a few hours after the death of his brother one of the people whom he most dearly loved when monsieur in the words of the duc de montfort is still warm we find louis xiv singing snatches from operas astonished that the duchesse de bourgogne who has difficulty in concealing her grief should be looking so woebegone and desiring that the gaiety of the court shall be at once resumed so that his courtiers may be encouraged to sit down to the tables ordering the duc de bourgogne to start a game of brelan well not only in his social and concentrated activities but in the most spontaneous utterances the ordinary preoccupations of m de guermantes the use he made of his time one found a similar contrast the guermantes were no more susceptible than other mortals to grief one might indeed say that their actual sensibility was lower on the other hand one saw their names every day in the social columns of the gaulois on account of the prodigious number of funerals at which they would have felt it a neglect of duty not to have their presence recorded as the traveller discovers almost unaltered the houses roofed with turf the terraces which may have met the eyes of xenophon or saint paul so in the manners of m de guermantes a man who melted ones heart by his courtesy and revolted it by his harshness i found still intact after the lapse of more than two centuries that deviation typical of court life under louis xiv which transfers all scruples of conscience from matters of the affections and morality and applies them to purely formal questions the other reason for the friendliness shewn me by the princesse de parme was of a more personal kind it was that she was convinced beforehand that everything that she saw at the duchesse de guermantess people and things alike was of a quality superior to that of anything that she had at home it is true that in all the other houses of her acquaintance she behaved as if this had been the case over the simplest dish the most ordinary flowers she was not satisfied with going into ecstasies she would ask leave to send round next morning to copy the recipe or to examine the variety of blossom her head cook or head gardener gentlemen with large salaries who kept their own carriages and were deeply humiliated at having to come to inquire after a dish they despised or to take notes of a kind of carnation that was not half so fine had not such ornamental streaks did not produce so large a blossom as those which they had long been growing for her at home but if in the princess wherever she went this astonishment at the sight of the most commonplace things was assumed and intended to shew that she did not derive from the superiority of her rank and riches a pride forbidden by her early instructors habitually dissembled by her mother and intolerable in the sight of her creator it was on the other hand in all sincerity that she regarded the drawingroom of the duchesse de guermantes as a privileged place in which she could pass only from surprise to delight to a certain extent for that matter though not nearly enough to justify this state of mind the guermantes were different from the rest of noble society they were rarer and more refined they had given me at first sight the opposite impression i had found them vulgar similar to all other men and women but because before meeting them i had seen in them as in balbec in florence in parma only names evidently in this drawingroom all the women whom i had imagined as being like porcelain figures were even more like the great majority of women but in the same way as balbec or florence the guermantes after first disappointing the imagination because they resembled their fellowcreatures rather than their name could subsequently though to a less degree appeal to the intellect by certain distinctive characteristics their bodily structure the colour a peculiar pink that merged at times into violet of their skins a certain almost flashing fairness of the finely spun hair even in the men on whom it was massed in soft golden tufts half a wallgrowing lichen half a catlike fur a luminous sparkle to which corresponded a certain brilliance of intellect for if people spoke of the guermantes complexion the guermantes hair they spoke also of the wit of the guermantes as of the wit of the mortemarts a certain social quality whose superior fineness was famed even before the days of louis xiv and all the more universally recognised since they published the fame of it themselves all this meant that in the material itself precious as that might be in which one found them embedded here and there the guermantes remained recognisable easy to detect and to follow like the veins whose paleness streaks a block of jasper or onyx or better still like the pliant waving of those tresses of light whose loosened hairs run like flexible rays along the sides of a mossagate the guermantes those at least who were worthy of the name were not only of a quality of flesh of hair of transparency of gaze that was exquisite but had a way of holding themselves of walking of bowing of looking at one before they shook ones hand of shaking hands which made them as different in all these respects from an ordinary person in society as he in turn was from a peasant in a smock and despite their friendliness one asked oneself have they not indeed the right though they waive it when they see us walk bow leave a room do any of those things which when performed by them become as graceful as the flight of a swallow or the bending of a rose on its stem to think these people are of another race than ours and we are we the true lords of creation later on i realised that the guermantes did indeed regard me as being of another race but one that aroused their envy because i possessed merits of which i knew nothing and which they professed to regard as alone important later still i came to feel that this profession of faith was only half sincere and that in them scorn or surprise could be coexistent with admiration and envy the physical flexibility essential to the guermantes was twofold thanks to one of its forms constantly in action at any moment and if for example a male guermantes were about to salute a lady he produced a silhouette of himself made from the unstable equilibrium of a series of asymmetrical movements with nervous compensations one leg dragging a little either on purpose or because having been broken so often in the huntingfield it imparted to his trunk in its effort to keep pace with the other a deviation to which the upward thrust of one shoulder gave a counterpoise while the monocle settled itself before his eye raising an eyebrow just as the tuft of hair on the forehead was lowered in the formal bow the other flexibility like the form of the wave the wind or the ocean track which is preserved on the she will or the vessel was so to speak stereotyped in a sort of fixed mobility curving the arched nose which beneath the blue protruding eyes above the overthin lips from which in the women there emerged a raucous voice recalled the fabulous origin attributed in the sixteenth century by the complaisance of parasitic and hellenising genealogists to his race ancient beyond dispute but not to the degree of antiquity which they claimed when they gave as its source the mythological impregnation of a nymph by a divine bird the guermantes were just as idiomatic from the intellectual as from the physical point of view with the exception of prince gilbert the husband with antiquated ideas of mariegilbert who made his wife sit on his left when they drove out together because her blood though royal was inferior to his own but he was an exception and furnished behind his back a perpetual laughingstock to the rest of the family who had always fresh anecdotes to tell of him the guermantes while living in the pure cream of aristocracy affected to take no account of nobility the theories of the duchesse de guermantes who to tell the truth by dint of being a guermantes became to a certain extent something different and more attractive subordinated everything else so completely to intellect and were in politics so socialistic that one asked oneself where in her mansion could be hiding the familiar spirit whose duty it was to ensure the maintenance of the aristocratic standard of living and which always invisible but evidently crouching at one moment in the entrance hall at another in the drawingroom at a third in her dressingroom reminded the servants of this woman who did not believe in titles to address her as mme la duchesse reminding also herself who cared only for reading and had no respect for persons to go out to dinner with her sisterinlaw when eight of the clock struck and to put on a low gown the same familiar spirit represented to mme de guermantes the social duties of duchesses of the foremost among them that was who like herself were multimillionaires the sacrifice to boring tea dinner and evening parties of hours in which she might have read interesting books as unpleasant necessities like rain which mme de guermantes accepted letting play on them her biting humour but without seeking in any way to justify her acceptance of them the curious accident by which the butler of mme de guermantes invariably said madame la duchesse to this woman who believed only in the intellect did not however appear to shock her never had it entered her head to request him to address her simply as madame giving her the utmost benefit of the doubt one might have supposed that thinking of something else at the time she had heard only the word madame and that the suffix appended to it had not caught her attention only though she might feign deafness she was not dumb in fact whenever she had a message to give to her husband she would say to the butler remind monsieur le duc the familiar spirit had other occupations as well one of which was to inspire them to talk morality it is true that there were guermantes who went in for intellect and guermantes who went in for morals and that these two classes did not as a rule coincide but the former kind including a guermantes who had forged cheques who cheated at cards and was the most delightful of them all with a mind open to every new and sound idea spoke even more eloquently upon morals than the others and in the same strain as mme de villeparisis at the moments in which the familiar spirit expressed itself through the lips of the old lady at corresponding moments one saw the guermantes adopt suddenly a tone almost as oldladylike as genial and as they themselves had more charm more touching than that of the marquise to say of a servant one feels that she has a thoroughly sound nature she is not at all a common girl she must come of decent parents she is certainly a girl who has never gone astray at such moments the familiar spirit took the form of an intonation but at times it could be bearing also the expression on a face the same in the duchess as in her grandfather the marshal a sort of undefinable convulsion like that of the serpent the genius of the carthaginian family of barca by which my heart had more than once been set throbbing on my morning walks when before i had recognised mme de guermantes i felt her eyes fastened upon me from the inside of a little dairy this familiar spirit had intervened in a situation which was far from immaterial not merely to the guermantes but to the courvoisiers the rival faction of the family and though of as good blood as the guermantes it was indeed through his courvoisier grandmother that the guermantes explained the obsession which led the prince de guermantes always to speak of birth and titles as though those were the only things that mattered their opposite in every respect not only did the courvoisiers not assign to intelligence the same importance as the guermantes they had not the same idea of it for a guermantes even were he a fool to be intelligent meant to have a sharp tongue to be capable of saying cutting things to get away with it but it meant also the capacity to hold ones own equally in painting music architecture to speak english the courvoisiers had formed a less favourable impression of intelligence and unless one were actually of their world being intelligent was almost tantamount to having probably murdered ones father and mother for them intelligence was the sort of burglars jemmy by means of which people one did not know from adam forced the doors of the most reputable drawingrooms and it was common knowledge among the courvoisiers that you always had to pay in the long run for having those sort of people in your house to the most trivial statements made by intelligent people who were not in society the courvoisiers opposed a systematic distrust some one having on one occasion remarked but swann is younger than palamedehe says so at any rate and if he says it you may be sure it is because he thinks it is to his interest had been mme de gallardons retort better still when some one said of two highly distinguished foreigners whom the guermantes had entertained that one of them had been sent in first because she was the elder but is she really the elder mme de gallardon had inquired not positively as though that sort of person did not have any age but as if presumably devoid of civil or religious status of definite traditions they were both more or less young like two kittens of the same litter between which only a veterinary surgeon was competent to decide the courvoisiers more than the guermantes maintained also in a certain sense the integrity of the titled class thanks at once to the narrowness of their minds and the bitterness of their hearts just as the guermantes for whom below the royal families and a few others like the lignes the la trémoilles and so forth all the rest were lost in a common rubbishheap were insolent towards various people of long descent who lived round guermantes simply because they paid no attention to those secondary distinctions by which the courvoisiers were enormously impressed so the absence of such distinctions affected them little certain women who did not hold any specially exalted rank in their native provinces but brilliantly married rich goodlooking beloved of duchesses were for paris where people are never very well up in who ones father and mother were an excellent and exclusive piece of imported goods it might happen though not commonly that such women were through the channel of the princesse de parme or by virtue of their own attractions received by certain guermantes but with regard to these the indignation of the courvoisiers knew no bounds having to meet between five and six in the afternoon at their cousins people with whose relatives their own relatives did not care to be seen mixing down in the perche became for them an everincreasing source of rage and an inexhaustible fount of rhetoric the moment for instance when the charming comtesse gentered the guermantes drawingroom the face of mme de villebon assumed exactly the expression that would have befitted it had she been called to recite the line and should but one stand fast that one were surely i a line which for that matter was unknown to her this courvoisier had consumed almost every monday an éclair stuffed with cream within a few feet of the comtesse g but to no consequence and mme de villebon confessed in secret that she could not conceive how her cousin guermantes could allow a woman into her house who was not even in the secondbest society of châteaudun i really fail to see why my cousin should make such a fuss about whom she knows it is making a perfect farce of society concluded mme de villebon with a change of facial expression this time a sly smile of despair which in a charade would have been interpreted rather as indicating another line of poetry though one with which she was no more familiar than with the first grâce aux dieux mon malheur passe mon espérance we may here anticipate events to explain that the persévérance which rhymes in the following line with espérance shewn by mme de villebon in snubbing mme gwas not entirely wasted in the eyes of mme g it invested mme de villebon with a distinction so supreme though purely imaginary that when the time came for mme gs daughter who was the prettiest girl and the greatest heiress in the ballrooms of that season to marry people were astonished to see her refuse all the dukes in succession the fact was that her mother remembering the weekly humiliations she had had to endure in the rue de grenelle on account of chateaudun could think of only one possible husband for her daughter a villebon son a single point at which guermantes and courvoisiers converged was the art one for that matter of infinite variety of marking distances the guermantes manners were not absolutely uniform towards everyone and yet to take an example all the guermantes all those who really were guermantes when you were introduced to them proceeded to perform a sort of ceremony almost as though the fact that they held out their hands to you had been as important as the conferring of an order of knighthood at the moment when a guermantes were he no more than twenty but treading already in the footsteps of his ancestors heard your name uttered by the person who introduced you he let fall on you as though he had by no means made up his mind to say how dye do a gaze generally blue always of the coldness of a steel blade which he seemed ready to plunge into the deepest recesses of your heart which was a matter of fact what the guermantes imagined themselves to be doing each of them regarding himself as a psychologist of the highest order they thought moreover that they increased by this inspection the affability of the salute which was to follow it and would not be rendered you without full knowledge of your deserts all this occurred at a distance from yourself which little enough had it been a question of a passage of arms seemed immense for a handclasp and had as chilling an effect in this connexion as in the other so that when the guermantes after a rapid twisting thrust that explored the most intimate secrets of your soul and laid bare your title to honour had deemed you worthy to associate with him thereafter his hand directed towards you at the end of an arm stretched out to its fullest extent appeared to be presenting a rapier at you for a single combat and that hand was in fact placed so far in advance of the guermantes himself at that moment that when he afterwards bowed his head it was difficult to distinguish whether it was yourself or his own hand that he was saluting certain guermantes lacking the sense of proportion or being incapable of refraining from repeating themselves incessantly went further and repeated this ceremony afresh every time that they met you seeing that they had no longer any need to conduct the preliminary psychological investigation for which the familiar spirit had delegated its powers to them and the result of which they had presumably kept in mind the insistence of the perforating gaze preceding the handclasp could be explained only by the automatism which their gaze had acquired or by some power of fascination which they believed themselves to possess the courvoisiers whose physique was different had tried in vain to assimilate that searching gaze and had had to fall back upon a lordly stiffness or a rapid indifference on the other hand it was from the courvoisiers that certain very exceptional guermantes of the gentler sex seemed to have borrowed the feminine form of greeting at the moment when you were presented to one of these she made you a sweeping bow in which she carried towards you almost to an angle of fortyfive degrees her head and bust the rest of her body which came very high up to the belt which formed a pivot remaining stationary but no sooner had she projected thus towards you the upper part of her person than she flung it backwards beyond the vertical line by a sudden retirement through almost the same angle this subsequent withdrawal neutralised what appeared to have been conceded to you the ground which you believed yourself to have gained did not even remain a conquest as in a duel the original positions were retained this same annulment of affability by the resumption of distance which was courvoisier in origin and intended to shew that the advances made in the first movement were no more than a momentary feint displayed itself equally clearly in the courvoisier ladies as in the guermantes in the letters which you received from them at any rate in the first period of your acquaintance the body of the letter might contain sentences such as one writes only you would suppose to a friend but in vain might you have thought yourself entitled to boast of being in that relation to the lady since the letter began with monsieur and ended with croyez monsieur a mes sentiments distingués after which between this cold opening and frigid conclusion which altered the meaning of all the rest there might come in succession were it a reply to a letter of condolence from yourself the most touching pictures of the grief which the guermantes lady had felt on losing her sister of the intimacy that had existed between them of the beauty of the place in which she was staying of the consolation that she found in the charm of her young children all this amounted to no more than a letter such as one finds in printed collections the intimate character of which implied however no more intimacy between yourself and the writer than if she had been the younger pliny or mme de simiane it is true that certain guermantes ladies wrote to you from the first as my dear friend or my friends these were not always the most simple natured among them but rather those who living only in the society of kings and being at the same time light assumed in their pride the certainty that everything which came from themselves gave pleasure and in their corruption the habit of setting no price upon any of the satisfactions that they had to offer however since to have had a common ancestor in the reign of louis xiii was enough to make a young guermantes say in speaking of the marquise de guermantes my aunt adam the guermantes were so numerous a clan that even among these simple rites that for example of the bow upon introduction to a stranger there existed a wide divergence each subsection of any refinement had its own which was handed down from parents to children like the prescription for a liniment or a special way of making jam thus it was that we saw saintloups handclasp thrust out as though involuntarily at the moment of his hearing ones name without any participation by his eyes without the addition of a bow any unfortunate commoner who for a particular reason which for that matter very rarely occurred was presented to anyone of the saintloup subsection racked his brains over this abrupt minimum of a greeting which deliberately assumed the appearance of nonrecognition to discover what in the world the guermantes male or female could have against him and he was highly surprised to learn that the said guermantes had thought fit to write specially to the introducer to tell him how delighted he or she had been with the stranger whom he or she looked forward to meeting again as specialised as the mechanical gestures of saintloup were the complicated and rapid capers which m de charlus condemned as ridiculous of the marquis de fierbois the grave and measured paces of the prince de guermantes but it is impossible to describe here the richness of the choreography of the guermantes ballet owing to the sheer length of the cast to return to the antipathy which animated the courvoisiers against the duchesse de guermantes they might have had the consolation of feeling sorry for her so long as she was still unmarried for she was then comparatively poor unfortunately at all times and seasons a sort of fuliginous emanation quite sut generis enveloped hid from the eye the wealth of the courvoisiers which however great it might be remained obscure in vain might a young courvoisier with an ample dowry find a most eligible bridegroom it invariably happened that the young couple had no house of their own in paris came up to stay in the season with his parents and for the rest of the year lived down in the country in the thick of a society that may have been unadulterated but was also quite undistinguished whereas a saintloup who was up to the eyes in debt dazzled doncieres with his carriagehorses a courvoisier who was extremely rich always went in the tram similarly though of course many years earlier mlle de guermantes oriane who had scarcely a penny to her name created more stir with her clothes than all the courvoisiers put together the really scandalous things she said gave a sort of advertisement to her style of dressing and doing her hair she had had the audacity to say to the russian grand duke well sir i hear you would like to have tolstoy murdered at a dinnerparty to which none of the courvoisiers not that any of them knew very much about tolstoy had been asked they knew little more about greek writers if we may judge by the dowager duchesse de gallardon motherinlaw of the princesse de gallardon who at that time was still a girl who not having been honoured by oriane with a single visit in five years replied to some one who asked her the reason for this abstention it seems she recites aristotle meaning aristophanes in society i cannot allow that sort of thing in my house one can imagine how greatly this sally by mlle de guermantes upon tolstoy if it enraged the courvoisiers delighted the guermantes and by derivation everyone who was not merely closely but even remotely attached to them the dowager comtesse dargencourt née seineport who entertained a little of everything because she was a bluestocking and in spite of her sons being a terrible snob repeated the saying before her literary friends with the comment oriane de guermantes you know she is as fine as amber as mischievous as a monkey there is nothing she could not do if she chose her watercolours are worthy of a great painter and she writes better s than most of the great poets and as for family do not you know you could not imagine anything better her grandmother was mlle de montpensier and she is the eighteenth oriane de guermantes in succession without a single misalliance it is the purest blood the oldest in the whole of france and so the sham men of letters those demiintellectuals who went to mme dargencourts forming a mental picture of oriane de guermantes whom they would never have an opportunity to know personally as something more wonderful and more extraordinary than princess badroulbadour not only felt themselves ready to die for her on learning that so noble a person glorified tolstoy above all others but felt also quickening with a fresh strength in their minds their own love of tolstoy their longing to fight against tsarism these liberal ideas might have grown faint in them they might have begun to doubt their importance no longer venturing to confess to holding them when suddenly from mlle de guermantes herself that is to say from a girl so indisputably cultured and authorised to speak who wore her hair flat on her brow a thing that no courvoisier would ever have consented to do came this vehement support a certain number of realities good or bad in themselves gain enormously in this way by receiving the adhesion of people who are in authority over us for instance among the courvoisiers the rites of affability in a public thoroughfare consisted in a certain bow very ugly and far from affable in itself but which people knew to be the distinguished way of bidding a person good day with the result that everyone else suppressing the instinctive smile of welcome on his own face endeavoured to imitate these frigid gymnastics but the guermantes in general and oriane in particular while better conversant than anyone with these rites did not hesitate if they caught sight of you from a carriage to greet you with a sprightly wave of the hand and in a drawingroom leaving the courvoisiers to make their stiff and imitative bows sketched charming reverences in the air held out their hands as though to a comrade with a smile from their blue eyes so that suddenly thanks to the guermantes there entered into the substance of smartness until then a little hollow and dry everything that you would naturally have liked and had compelled yourself to forego a genuine welcome the effusion of a true friendliness spontaneity it is in a similar fashion but by a rehabilitation which this time is scarcely justified that people who carry in themselves an instinctive taste for bad music and for melodies however commonplace which have in them something easy and caressing succeed by dint of education in symphonic culture in mortifying that appetite but once they have arrived at this point when dazzled and rightly so by the brilliant orchestral colouring of richard strauss they see that musician adopt with an indulgence worthy of auber the most vulgar motifs what those people originally admired finds suddenly in so high an authority a justification which delights them and they let themselves be enchanted without scruple and with a twofold gratitude when they listen to salomé by what it would have been impossible for them to admire in les diamants de la couronne authentic or not the retort made by mlle de guermantes to the grand duke retailed from house to house furnished an opportunity to relate the excessive smartness with which oriane had been turned out at the dinnerparty in question but if such splendour and this is precisely what rendered it unattainable by the courvoisiers springs not from wealth but from prodigality the latter does nevertheless last longer if it enjoys the constant support of the former which allows it to spend all its fire given the principles openly advertised not only by oriane but by mlle de villeparisis namely that nobility does not count that it is ridiculous to bother ones head about rank that wealth does not necessarily mean happiness that intellect heart talent are alone of importance the courvoisiers were justified in hoping that as a result of the training she had received from the marquise oriane would marry some one who was not in society an artist a fugitive from justice a scallawag a freethinker that she would pass definitely into the category of what the courvoisiers called detrimentals they were all the more justified in this hope since inasmuch as mme de villeparisis was at this very moment from the social point of view passing through an awkward crisis none of the few bright stars whom i was to meet in her drawingroom had as yet reappeared there she professed an intense horror of the society which was thus holding her aloof even when she referred to her nephew the prince de guermantes whom she did still see she could never make an end of mocking at him because he was so infatuated about his pedigree but the moment it became a question of finding a husband for oriane it had been no longer the principles publicly advertised by aunt and niece that had controlled the operations it had been the mysterious familiar spirit of their race as unerringly as if mme de villeparisis and oriane had never spoken of anything but rentrolls and pedigrees in place of literary merit and depth of character and as if the marquise for the space of a few days had been as she would ultimately be dead and on her bier in the church of combray where each member of the family would be reduced to a mere guermantes with a forfeiture of individuality and baptismal names to which there testified on the voluminous black drapery of the pall the single g in purple surmounted by the ducal coronet it was on the wealthiest man and the most nobly born on the most eligible bachelor of the faubourg saintgermain on the eldest son of the duc de guermantes the prince des laumes that the familiar spirit had let fall the choice of the intellectual the critical the evangelical mme de villeparisis and for a couple of hours on the day of the wedding mme de villeparisis received in her drawingroom all the noble persons at whom she had been in the habit of sneering at whom she indeed sneered still to the various plebeian intimates whom she had invited and on whom the prince des laumes promptly left cards preparatory to cutting the cable in the following year and then making the courvoisiers cup of bit terness overflow the same old maxims which made out intellect and talent to be the sole claims to social preeminence resumed their doctrinal fore in the household of the princesse des laumes immediately after her mar riage and in this respect be it said in passing the point of view which saintloup upheld when he lived with rachel frequented the friends of rachel would have liked to marry rachel implied whatever the horror that it inspired in the family less falsehood than that of the guermantes young ladies in general preaching the virtues of intellect barely admitting the possibility of anyones questioning the equality of mankind all of which ended at a given point in the same result as if they had professed the opposite principles that is to say in marriage to an extremely wealthy duke saintloup did on the contrary act in conformity with his theories which led people to say that he was treading in evil ways certainly from the moral standpoint rachel was not altogether satisfactory but it is by no means certain whether if she had been some person no more worthy but a duchess or the heiress to many millions mme de marsantes would not have been in favour of the match well to return to mme des laumes shortly afterwards duchesse de guermantes on the death of her fatherinlaw it was the last agonising straw upon the backs of the courvoisiers that the theories of the young princess remaining thus lodged in her speech should not in any sense be guiding her conduct with the result that this philosophy if one may so call it in no way impaired the aristocratic smartness of the guermantes drawingroom no doubt all the people whom mme de guermantes did not invite imagined that it was because they were not clever enough and some rich american lady who had never had any book in her possession except a little old copy never opened of parnys poems arranged because it was of the period upon one of the tables in her inner room shewed how much importance she attached to the things of the mind by the devouring gaze which she fastened on the duchesse de guermantes when that lady made her appearance at the opera no doubt also mme de guermantes was sincere when she selected a person on account of his or her intellect when she said of a woman it appears she is quite charming or of a man that he was the cleverest person in the world she imagined herself to have no other reason for consenting to receive them than this charm or cleverness the familiar spirit not interposing itself at this last moment more deeply rooted stationed at the obscure entry of the region in which the guermantes exercised their judgment this vigilant spirit precluded them from finding the man clever or the woman charming if they had no social value actual or potential the man was pronounced learned but like a dictionary or on the contrary common with the mind of a commercial traveller the woman pretty but with a terribly bad style or too talkative as for the people who had no definite position they were simply dreadful such snobs m de bréauté whose country house was quite close to guermantes mixed with no one below the rank of highness but he laughed at them in his heart and longed only to spend his days in museums accordingly mme de guermantes was indignant when anyone spoke of m de bréauté as a snob a snob babal but my poor friend you must be mad it is just the opposite he loathes smart people he will not let himself be introduced to anyone even in my house if i ask him to meet some one he does not know he swears at me all the time this was not to say that even in practice the guermantes did not adopt an entirely different attitude towards cleverness from the courvoisiers in a positive sense this difference between the guermantes and the courvoisiers had begun already to bear very promising fruit thus the duchesse de guermantes enveloped moreover in a mystery which had set so many poets dreaming of her at a respectful distance had given that party to which i have already referred at which the king of england had enjoyed himself more thoroughly than anywhere else for she had had the idea which would never have occurred to a courvoisier mind of inviting and the audacity from which a courvoisier courage would have recoiled to invite apart from the personages already mentioned the musician gaston lemaire and the dramatist grandmougin but it was preeminently from the negative point of view that intellectuality made itself felt if the necessary coefficient of cleverness and charm declined steadily as the rank of the person who sought an invitation from the princesse des laumes became more exalted vanishing into zero when he or she was one of the principal crowned heads of europe conly the farther they fell below this royal level the higher the coefficient rose for instance at the princesse de parmes parties there were a number of people whom her royal highness invited because she had known them as children or because they were related to some duchess or attached to the person of some sovereign they themselves being quite possibly ugly boring or stupid well with a courvoisier any of the reasons a favourite of the princesse de parme a niece on the mothers side of the duchesse darpajon spends three months every year with the queen of spain would have been sufficient to make her invite such people to her house but mme de guermantes who had politely acknowledged their bows for ten years at the princesse de parmes had never once allowed them to cross her threshold considering that the same rule applied to a drawingroom in a social as in a material sense where it only needed a few pieces of furniture which had no particular beauty but were left there to fill the room and as a sign of the owners wealth to render it hideous such a drawingroom resembled a book in which the author could not refrain from the use of language advertising his own learning brilliance fluency like a book like a house the quality of a salon thought mme de guermantes and rightly is based on the cornerstone of sacrifice many of the friends of the princesse de parme with whom the duchesse de guermantes had confined herself for years past to the same conventional greeting or to returning their cards without ever inviting them to her parties or going to theirs complained discreetly of these omissions to her highness who on days when m de guermantes came by himself to see her passed on a hint to him but the wily nobleman a bad husband to the duchess in so far as he kept mistresses but her most tried and trusty friend in everything that concerned the good order of her drawingroom and her own wit which formed its chief attraction replied but doe my wife know her indeed oh well i daresay she does but the truth is madam that oriane does not care for womens conversation she lives surrounded by a court of superior minds i am not her husband i am only the first footman except for quite a small number who are all of them very clever indeed women bore her surely madam your highness with all her fine judgment is not going to tell me that the marquise de souvré has any brains yes i quite understand the princess receives her out of kindness besides your highness knows her you tell me that oriane has met her it is quite possible but once or twice at the most i assure you and then i must explain to your highness it is really a little my fault as well my wife is very easily tired and she is so anxious to be friendly always that if i allowed her she would never stop going to see people only yesterday evening she had a temperature she was afraid of hurting the duchesse de bourbons feelings by not going to see her i had to shew my teeth i assure you i positively forbade them to bring the carriage round do you know madam i should really prefer not to mention to oriane that you have spoken to me about mme de souvré my wife is so devoted to your highness she will go round at once to invite mme de souvré to the house that will mean another call to be paid it will oblige us to make friends with the sister whose husband i know quite well i think i shall say nothing at all about it to oriane if the princess has no objection that will save her a great deal of strain and excitement and i assure you that it will be no loss to mme de souvré she goes everywhere moves in the most brilliant circles you know we do not entertain at all really just a few little friendly dinners mme de souvré would be bored to death the princesse de parme innocently convinced that the duc de guermantes would not transmit her request to his duchess and dismayed by her failure to procure the invitation that mme de souvré sought was all the more flattered to think that she herself was one of the regular frequenters of so exclusive a household no doubt this satisfaction had its drawbacks also thus whenever the princesse de parme invited mme de guermantes to her own parties she had to rack her brains to be sure that there was no one else on her list whose presence might offend the duchess and make her refuse to come again on ordinary evenings after dinner at which she invariably entertained at a very early hour for she clung to old customs a small party the drawingroom of the princesse de parme was thrown open to her regular guests and generally speaking to all the higher ranks of the aristocracy french and foreign the order of her receptions was as follows on issuing from the diningroom the princess sat down on a sofa before a large round table and chatted with the two most important of the ladies who had dined with her or else cast her eyes over a magazine or sometimes played cards or pretended to play adopting a german court custom either a game of patience by herself or selecting as her real or pretended partner some prominent personage by nine of the clock the double doors of the big drawingroom were in a state of perpetual agitation opening and shutting and opening again to admit the visitors who had dined quietly at home or if they had dined in town hurried from their café promising to return later since they intended only to go in at one door and out at the other in order to conform with the princesss timetable she meanwhile her mind fixed on her game or conversation made a show of not seeing the new arrivals and it was not until they were actually within reach of her that she rose graciously from her seat with a friendly smile for the women the latter thereupon sank before the upright presence in a courtesy which was tantamount to a genuflexion so as to bring their lips down to the level of the beautiful hand which hung very low and to kiss it but at that moment the princess just as if she had been every time surprised by a formality with which nevertheless she was perfectly familiar raised the kneeling figure as though by main force and with incomparable grace and sweetness and kissed her on both cheeks a grace and sweetness that were conditional you may say upon the meekness with which the arriving guest inclined her knee very likely and it seems that in a society without distinctions of rank politeness would vanish not as is generally supposed from want of breeding but because from one class would have vanished the deference due to a distinction which must be imaginary to be effective and more completely still from the other class the affability in the distribution of which one is prodigal so long as one knows it to be to the recipient of an untold value which in a world based on equality would at once fall to nothing like everything that has only a promissory worth but this disappearance of politeness in a reconstructed society is by no means certain and we are at times too ready to believe that the present is the only possible state of things people of firstrate intelligence have held the opinion that a republic could not have any diplomacy or foreign alliances and more recently that the peasant class would not tolerate the separation of church and state after all the survival of politeness in a society levelled to uniformity would be no more miraculous than the practical success of the railway or the use of the aeroplane in war besides even if politeness were to vanish there is nothing to shew that this would be a misfortune lastly would not society become secretly more hierarchical as it became outwardly more democratic this seems highly probable the political power of the popes has grown enormously since they ceased to possess either states or an army our cathedrals meant far less to a devout catholic of the seventeenth century than they mean to an atheist of the twentieth and if the princesse de parme had been the sovereign ruler of a state no doubt i should have felt myself impelled to speak of her almost as i should speak of a president of the republic that is to say not at all as soon as the postulant had been raised from the ground and embraced by the princess the latter resumed her seat and returned to her game of patience but first of all if the newcomer were of any importance held her for a moment in conversation making her sit down in an armchair when the room became too crowded the lady in waiting who had to control the traffic cleared the floor by leading the regular guests into an immense hall on to which the drawingroom opened a hall filled with portraits and minor trophies of the house of bourbon the intimate friends of the princess would then volunteer for the part of guide and would repeat interesting anecdotes to which the young people had not the patience to listen more interested in the spectacle of living royalties with the possibility of having themselves presented to them by the lady in waiting and the maids of honour than in examining the relics of dead sovereigns too much occupied with the acquaintances which they would be able to form and the invitations it might perhaps be possible to secure they knew absolutely nothing even in afteryears of what there was in this priceless museum of the archives of the monarchy and could only recall confusedly that it was decorated with cacti and giant palms which gave this centre of social elegance a look of the palmarium in the jardin dacclimatation naturally the duchesse de guermantes by way of selfmortification did occasionally appear on these evenings to pay an after dinner call on the princess who kept her all the time by her side while she rallied the duke but on evenings when the duchess came to dine the princess took care not to invite her regular party and closed her doors to the world on rising from table for fear lest a too liberal selection of guests might offend the exacting duchess on such evenings were any of the faithful who had not received warning to present themselves on the royal doorstep they would be informed by the porter her royal highness is not at home this evening and would turn away but long before this many of the princesss friends had known that on the day in question they would not be asked to her house these were a special set of parties a privilege barred to so many who must have longed for admission the excluded could with a practical certainty enumerate the roll of the elect and would say irritably among themselves you know of course that oriane de guermantes never goes anywhere without her entire staff with the help of this body the princesse de parme sought to surround the duchess as with a protecting rampart against those persons the chance of whose making a good impression on her was at all doubtful but with several of the duchesss favourites with several members of this glittering staff the princesse de parme resented having to go out of her way to shew them attentions seeing that they paid little or no attention to herself no doubt the princess was fully prepared to admit that it was possible to derive more enjoyment in the company of the duchesse de guermantes than in her own she could not deny that there was always a crush on the duchesss athome days or that she herself often met there three or four royal personages who thought it sufficient to leave their cards upon her and in vain might she commit to memory orianes witty sayings copy her gowns serve at her own tea parties the same strawberry tarts there were occasions on which she was left by herself all afternoon with a lady in waiting and some foreign counsellor of legation and so whenever as had been the case with swann for instance at an earlier period there was anyone who never let a day pass without going to spend an hour or two at the duchesss and paid a call once in two years on the princesse de parme the latter felt no great desire even for the sake of amusing oriane to make to this swann or whoever he was the advances of an invitation to dinner in a word having the duchess in her house was for the princess a source of endless perplexity so haunted was she by the fear that oriane would find fault with everything but in return and for the same reason when the princesse de parme came to dine with mme de guermantes she could be certain beforehand that everything would be perfect delightful she had only one fear which was that of her own inability to understand remember give satisfaction her inability to assimilate new ideas and people on this account my presence aroused her attention and excited her cupidity just as might a new way of decorating the dinnertable with festoons of fruit uncertain as she was which of the two it might be the table decorations or my presence that was the more distinctively one of those charms the secret of the success of orianes parties and in her uncertainty firmly resolved to try at her own next dinnerparty to introduce them both what for that matter fully justified the enraptured curiosity which the princesse de parme brought to the duchesss house was that element amusing dangerous exciting into which the princess used to plunge with a combination of anxiety shock and delight as at the seaside on one of those days of big waves of the danger of which the bathingmasters warn us simply and solely because none of them knows how to swim from which she used to emerge terrified happy rejuvenated and which was known as the wit of the guermantes the wit of the guermantes a thing as nonexistent as the squared circle according to the duchess who regarded herself as the sole guermantes to possess it was a family reputation like that of the pork pies of tours or the biscuits of rheims no doubt since an intellectual peculiarity does not employ for its perpetuation the same channels as a shade of hair or complexion certain intimate friends of the duchess who were not of her blood were nevertheless endowed with this wit which on the other hand had failed to permeate the minds of various guermantes too refractory to assimilate wit of any kind the holders not related to the duchess of this guermantes wit had generally the characteristic feature of having been brilliant men fitted for a career to which whether it were in the arts diplomacy parliamentary eloquence or the army they had preferred the life of a small and intimate group possibly this preference could be explained by a certain want of originality of initiative of will power of health or of luck or possibly by snobbishness with certain people though these it must be admitted were the exception if the guermantes drawingroom had been the stumblingblock in their careers it had been without their knowledge thus a doctor a painter and a diplomat of great promise had failed to achieve success in the careers for which they were nevertheless more brilliantly endowed than most of their competitors because their friendship with the guermantes had the result that the two former were regarded as men of fashion and the third as a reactionary which had prevented each of the three from winning the recognition of his colleagues the mediaeval gown and red cap which are still donned by the electoral colleges of the faculties are or were at least not so long since something more than a purely outward survival from a narrowminded past from a rigid sectarianism under the cap with its golden tassels like the high priest in the conical mitre of the jews the professors were still in the years that preceded the dreyfus case fast rooted in rigorously pharisaical ideas du boulbon was at heart an artist but was safe because he did not care for society cottard was always at the verdurins but mme verdurin was a patient besides he was protected by his vulgarity finally at his own house he entertained no one outside the faculty at banquets over which there floated an aroma of carbolic but in powerful corporations where moreover the rigidity of their prejudices is but the price that must be paid for the noblest integrity the most lofty conceptions of morality which weaken in an atmosphere that more tolerant freer at first becomes very soon dissolute a professor in his gown of scarlet satin faced with ermine like that of a doge which is to say a duke of venice enshrined in the ducal palace was as virtuous as deeply attached to noble principles but as unsparing of any alien element as that other duke excellent but terrible whom we know as m de saintsimon the alien here was the wordly doctor with other manners other social relations to make good the unfortunate of whom we are now speaking so as not to be accused by his colleagues of looking down on them the strange ideas of a man of fashion if he concealed from them his duchesse de guermantes hoped to disarm them by giving mixed dinnerparties in which the medical element was merged in the fashionable he was unaware that in so doing he signed his own deathwarrant or rather he discovered this later when the council of ten had to fill a vacant chair and it was invariably the name of another doctor more normal it might be obviously inferior that leaped from the fatal urn when their veto thundered from the ancient faculty as solemn as absurd and as terrible as the juro that spelled the death of moliere so too with the painter permanently labelled man of fashion when fashionable people who dabbled in art had succeeded in making themselves be labelled artists so with the diplomat who had too many reactionary associations but this case was the rarest of all the type of distinguished man who formed the main substance of the guermantes drawingroom was that of people who had voluntarily or so at least they supposed renounced all else everything that was incompatible with the wit of the guermantes with the courtesy of the guermantes with that indefinable charm odious to any corporation however little centralised and the people who were aware that in days gone by one of these frequenters of the duchesss drawingroom had been awarded the gold medal of the salon that another secretary to the bar council had made a brilliant start in the chamber that a third had ably served france as chargé daffaires might have been led to regard as failures people who had done nothing more now for twenty years but there were few who were thus wellinformed and the parties concerned would themselves have been the last to remind people finding these old distinctions to be now valueless in the light of this very guermantes spirit of wit for did not this condemn respectively as a bore or an usher and as a counterjumper a pair of eminent ministers one a trifle solemn the other addicted to puns of whose praises the newspapers were always full but in whose company mme de guermantes would begin to yawn and shew signs of impatience if the imprudence of a hostess had placed either of them next to her at the dinnertable since being a statesman of the first rank was in no sense a recommendation to the duchesss favour those of her friends who had definitely abandoned the career or the service who had never stood for the chamber felt as they came day after day to have luncheon and talk with their great friend or when they met her in the houses of royal personages of whom for that matter they thought very little or at least they said so that they themselves had chosen the better part albeit their melancholy air even in the midst of the gaiety seemed somehow to challenge the soundness of this opinion it must be recognised also that the refinement of social life the subtlety of conversation at the guermantes did also contain exiguous as it may have been an element of reality no official title was equivalent to the approval of certain chosen friends of mme de guermantes whom the most powerful ministers had been unable to attract to their houses if in this drawingroom so many intellectual ambitions such noble efforts even had been for ever buried still at least from their dust the rarest blossoms of civilised society had taken life certainly men of wit swann for instance regarded themselves as superior to men of genuine worth whom they despised but that was because what the duchesse de guermantes valued above everything else was not intellect it was according to her that superior more exquisite form of the human intellect exalted to a verbal variety of talent wit and long ago at the verdurins when swann condemned brichot and elstir one as a pedant and the other as a clown despite all the learning of one and the others genius it was the infiltration of the guermantes spirit that had led him to classify them so never would he have dared to present either of them to the duchess conscious instinctively of the air with which she would have listened to brichots monologues and elstirs hairsplittings the guermantes spirit regarding pretentious and prolix speech whether in a serious or a farcical vein as alike of the most intolerable imbecility as for the guermantes of the true flesh and blood if the guermantes spirit had not absorbed them as completely as we see occur in to take an example those literary circles in which everyone shares a common way of pronouncing his words of expressing his thoughts and consequently of thinking it was certainly not because originality is stronger in purely social groups or presents any obstacle there to imitation but imitation depends not merely upon the absence of any unconquerable originality but also demands a relative fineness of ear which enables one first of all to discern what one is afterwards to imitate whereas there were several guermantes in whom this musical sense was as entirely lacking as in the courvoisiers to take as an instance what is called in another sense of the word imitation giving imitations or among the guermantes was called taking off mme de guermantes might succeed in this to perfection the courvoisiers were as incapable of appreciating her as if they had been a tribe of rabbits instead of men and women because they had never had the sense to observe the particular defect or accent that the duchess was endeavouring to copy when she gave an imitation of the duc de limoges the courvoisiers would protest oh no he does not really speak like that i met him again only yesterday at dinner at bebeths he talked to me all evening and he did not speak like that at all whereas the guermantes of any degree of culture exclaimed gad what fun oriane is the odd part of it is that when she is copying him she looks exactly like him i feel i am listening to him oriane do give us a little more limoges now these guermantes and not necessarily the few really outstanding members of the clan who when the duchess imitated the duc de limoges would say admiringly oh you really have got him or you do get him might indeed be del void of wit according to mme de guermantes and in this respect she was right yet by dint of hearing and repeating her sayings they had come to imitate more or less her way of expressing herself of criticising people of what swann like the duke himself used to call her phrasing of things so that they presented in their conversation something which to the courvoisiers appeared fearfully like orianes wit and was treated by them collectively as the wit of the guermantes as these guermantes were to her not merely kinsfolk but admirers oriane who kept the rest of the family rigorously at armslength and now avenged by her disdain the insults that they had heaped upon her in her girlhood went to call on them now and then generally in company with the duke in the season when she drove out with him these visits were historic events the heart began to beat more rapidly in the bosom of the princesse depinay who was at home in her big drawingroom on the ground floor when she perceived afar off like the first glow of an innocuous fire or the reconnaissances of an unexpected invasion making her way across the courtyard slowly in a diagonal course the duchess crowned with a ravishing hat and holding atilt a sunshade from which there rained down a summer fragrance why here comes oriane she would say like an on guard intended to convey a prudent warning to her visitors so that they should have time to beat an orderly retreat to clear the rooms without panic half of those present dared not remain and rose at once to go but no why sit down again i insist on keeping you a little longer said the princess in a careless tone and seemingly at her ease to shew herself the great lady but in a voice that suddenly rang false but you may want to talk to each other really you are in a hurry oh very well i shall come and see you replied the lady of the house to those whom she was just as well pleased to see depart the duke and duchess gave a very civil greeting to people whom they had seen there regularly for years without for that reason coming to know them any better while these in return barely said good day to them thinking this more discreet scarcely had they left the room before the duke began asking goodnaturedly who they were so as to appear to be taking an interest in the intrinsic quality of people whom he himself owing to the crosspurposes of fate or the wretched state of orianes nerves never saw in his own house tell me who was that little woman in the pink hat why my dear cousin you have seen her hundreds of times she is the vicomtesse de tours who was a lamarzelle but do you know she is quite goodlooking she seems clever too if it were not for a little flaw in her upper lip she would be a regular charmer if there is a vicomte de tours he cannot have any too bad a time oriane do you know what those eyebrows and the way her hair grows reminded me of your cousin hedwige de ligne the duchesse de guermantes who languished whenever people spoke of the beauty of any woman other than herself let the conversation drop she bad reckoned without the weakness her husband had for letting it be seen that he knew all about the people who did not come to his house whereby be believed that he shewed himself to be more seriously minded than his wife but he resumed suddenly with emphasis you mentioned the name lamarzelle i remember when i was in the chamber hearing a really remarkable speech made that was the uncle of the young woman you saw just now indeed what talent no my dear girl he assured the vicomtesse degremont whom mme de guermantes could not endure but who refusing to stir from the princesse depinays drawingroom where she willingly humbled herself to play the part of parlourmaid and was ready to slap her own parlourmaid on returning home stayed there confused tearful but stayed when the ducal couple were in the room took their cloaks tried to make herself useful offered discreetly to withdraw into the next room you are not to make tea for us let us just sit and talk quietly we are simple souls really honestly besides he went on turning to the princesse depinay leaving the egremont lady blushing humble ambitious and full of zeal we can only give you a quarter of an hour this quarter of an hour was entirely taken up with a sort of exhibition of the witty things which the duchess had said during the previous week and to which she herself would certainly not have referred had not her husband with great adroitness by appearing to be rebuking her with reference to the incidents that had provoked them obliged her as though against her will to repeat them the princesse depinay who was fond of her cousin and knew that she had a weakness for compliments went into ecstasies over her hat her sunshade her wit talk to her as much as you like about her clothes said the duke in the sullen tone which he had adopted and now tempered with a sardonic smile so that his resentment should not be taken seriously but for heavens sake do not speak of her wit i should be only too glad not to have so witty a wife you are probably alluding to the shocking pun she made about my brother palamede he went on knowing quite well that the princess and the rest of the family had not yet heard this pun and delighted to have an opportunity of shewing off his wife in the first place i consider it unworthy of a person who has occasionally i must admit said some quite good things to make bad puns but especially about my brother who is very susceptible and if it is going to lead to his quarrelling with me that would really be too much of a good thing but we never heard a word about it one of orianes puns it is sure to be delicious oh do tell us no no the duke went on still sulking though with a broader smile i am so glad you have not heard it seriously i am very fond of my brother listen basin broke in the duchess the moment having come for her to take up her husbands cue i cannot think why you should say that it might annoy palamede you know quite well it would do nothing of the sort he is far too intelligent to be vexed by a stupid joke which has nothing offensive about it you are making them think i said something nasty i simply uttered a remark which was not in the least funny it is you who make it seem important by losing your temper over it i do not understand you you are making us terribly excited what is it all about oh obviously nothing serious cried m de guermantes you may have heard that my brother offered to give brézé the place he got from his wife to his sister marsantes yes but we were told that she did not want it she did not care for that part of the country the climate did not suit her very well some one had been telling my wife all that and saying that if my brother was giving this place to our sister it was not so much to please her as to tease her he is such a teaser charlus was what they actually said well you know brézé it is a royal domain i should say it is worth millions it used to be part of the crown lands it includes one of the finest forests in the whole of france there are plenty of people who would be only too delighted to be teased to that tune and so when she heard the word teaser applied to charlus because he was giving away such a magnificent property oriane could not help exclaiming without meaning anything i must admit there was not a trace of illnature about it for it came like a flash of lightning teaser teaser then he must be teaser augustus you understand he went on resuming his sulky tone having first cast a sweeping glance round the room in order to judge the effect of his wifes witticism and in some doubt as to the extent of mme depinays acquaintance with ancient history you understand it is an allusion to augustus caesar the roman emperor it is too stupid a bad play on words quite unworthy of oriane and then you see i am more circumspect than my wife if i have not her wit i think of the consequences if anyone should be so illadvised as to repeat the remark to my brother there will be the devil to pay all the more he went on because as you know palamede is very high and mighty and very fussy also given to gossip and all that sort of thing so that quite apart from the question of his giving away brézé you must admit that teaser augustus suits him down to the ground that is what justifies my wifes remarks even when she is inclined to stoop to what is almost vulgar she is always witty and does really describe people and so thanks on one occasion to teaser augustus on another to something else the visits paid by the duke and duchess to their kinsfolk replenished the stock of anecdotes and the emotion which these visits aroused lasted long after the departure of the sparkling lady and her producer her hostess would begin by going over again with the privileged persons who had been at the entertainment those who had remained in the room the clever things that oriane had said you had not heard teaser augustus asked the princesse depinay yes replied the marquise de baveno blushing as she spoke the princesse de sarsina the la rochefoucauld one mentioned it to me not quite in the same words but of course it was far more interesting to hear it repeated like that with my cousin in the room she went on as though speaking of a song that had been accompanied by the composer himself we were speaking of orianes latest she was here just now her hostess greeted a visitor who would be plunged in despair at not having arrived an hour earlier what has oriane been here yes you ought to have come a little sooner the princesse depinay informed her not in reproach but letting her understand all that her clumsiness had made her miss it was her fault alone if she had not been present at the creation of the world or at mme carvalhos last performance what do you think of orianes latest i must say i do enjoy teaser augustus and the saying would be served up again cold next day at luncheon before a few intimate friends who were invited on purpose and would reappear under various sauces throughout the week indeed the princess happening in the course of that week to pay her annual visit to the princesse de parme seized the opportunity to ask whether her royal highness had heard the pun and repeated it to her ah teaser augustus said the princesse de parme her eyes bulging with an instinctive admiration which begged however for a complementary elucidation which mme depinay was not loath to furnish i must say teaser augustus pleases me enormously as a piece of phrasing she concluded as a matter of fact the word phrasing was not in the least applicable to this pun but the princesse depinay who claimed to have assimilated her share of the guermantes spirit had borrowed from oriane the expressions phrased and phrasing and employed them without much discrimination new the princesse de parme who was not at all fond of mme depinay whom she considered plain knew to be miserly and believed on the authority of the courvoisiers to be malicious recognised this word phrasing which she had heard used by mme de guermantes but would not by herself have known how or when to apply she received the impression that it was in fact its phrasing that formed the charm of teaser augustus and without altogether forgetting her antipathy towards the plain and miserly lady could not repress a burst of admiration for a person endowed to such a degree with the guermantes spirit so strong that she was on the point of inviting the princesse depinay to the opera she was held in check only by the reflexion that it would be wiser perhaps to consult mme de guermantes first as for mme depinay who unlike the courvoisiers paid endless attentions to oriane and was genuinely fond of her but was jealous of her exalted friends and slightly irritated by the fun which the duchess used to make of her before everyone on account of her meanness she reported on her return home what an effort it had required to make the princesse de parme grasp the point of teaser augustus and declared what a snob oriane must be to number such a goose among her friends i should never have been able to see much of the princesse de parme even if i had cared to she informed the friends who were dining with her m depinay would not have allowed it for a moment because of her immorality she explained alluding to certain purely imaginary excesses on the part of the princess but even if i had had a husband less strict in his views i must say i could never have made friends with her i do not know how oriane can bear to see her every other day as she does i go there once a year and it is all i can do to sit out my call as for those of the courvoisiers who happened to be at victurniennes on the day of mme de guermantess visit the arrival of the duchess generally put them to flight owing to the exasperation they felt at the ridiculous salaams that were made to her there one alone remained on the afternoon of teaser augustus he did not entirely see the point but he did see part of it being an educated man and the courvoisiers went about repeating that oriane had called uncle palarned caesar augustus which was according to them a good enough descrin tion of him but why all this endless talk about oriane they went on people could not make more fuss about a queen after all what is oriane i do not say that the guermantes are not an old family but the courvoisiers are every bit as good in rank antiquity marriages we must not forget that on the field of the cloth of gold when the king of england asked françois i who was the noblest of the lords there present sire said the king of france courvoisier but even if all the courvoisiers had stayed in the room to hear them orianes sayings would have fallen on deaf ears since the incidents that usually gave occasion for those sayings would have been regarded by them from a totally different point of view if for instance a courvoisier found herself running short of chairs in the middle of a party or if she used the wrong name in greeting a guest whose face she did not remember or if one of her servants said something stupid the courvoisier extremely annoyed flushed quivering with excitement would deplore so unfortunate an occurrence and when she had a visitor in the room and oriane was expected she would say in a tone anxiously and imperiously questioning do you know her fearing that if the visitor did not know her his presence might make an unfortunate impression on oriane but mme de guermantes on the contrary extracted from such incidents opportunities for stories which made the guermantes laugh until the tears streamed down their cheeks so that one was obliged to envy her her having run short of chairs having herself made or having allowed her servant to make a blunder having had at her party some one whom nobody knew as one is obliged to be thankful that great writers have been kept at a distance by men and betrayed by women when their humiliations and their sufferings have been if not the direct stimulus of their genius at any rate the subject matter of their works the courvoisiers were incapable of rising to the level of the spirit of innovation which the duchesse de guermantes introduced into the life of society and by adapting it following an unerring instinct to the necessities of the moment made into something artistic where the purely rational application of cut and dried rules would have given as unfortunate results as would greet a man who anxious to succeed in love or in politics was to reproduce in his own daily life the exploits of bussy damboise if the courvoisiers gave a family dinner or a dinner to meet some prince the addition of a recognised wit of some friend of their son seemed to them an anomaly capable of producing the direst consequences a courvoisier whose father had been a minister of the empire having to give an afternoon party to meet princesse mathilde deduced by a geometrical formula that she could invite no one but bonapartists of whom she knew practically none all the smart women of her acquaintance all the amusing men were ruthlessly barred because from their legitimist views or connexions they might easily according to courvoisier logic give offence to the imperial highness the latter who in her own house entertained the flower of the faubourg saintgermain was quite surprised when she found at mme de courvoisiers only a notorious old sponger whose husband had been an imperial prefect the widow of the director of posts and sundry others known for their loyalty to napoleon their stupidity and their dullness princesse mathilde however in no way stinted the generous and refreshing shower of her sovereign grace over these miserable scarecrows whom the duchesse de guermantes for her part took good care not to invite when it was her turn to entertain the princess but substituted for them without any abstract reasoning about bonapartism the most brilliant coruscation of all the beauties all the talents all the celebrities who the exercise of some subtle sixth sense made her feel would be acceptable to the niece of the emperor even when they belonged actually to the royal house there was not lacking indeed the due daumale and when on withdrawing the princess raising mme de guermantes from the ground where she had sunk in a curtsey and was trying to kiss the august hand embraced her on both cheeks it was from the bottom of her heart that she was able to assure the duchess that never had she spent a happier afternoon nor seen so delightful a party the princesse de parme was courvoisier in her incapacity for innovation in social matters but unlike the courvoisiers the surprise that was perpetually caused her by the duchesse de guermantes engendered in her not as in them antipathy but admiration this astonishment was still farther enhanced by the infinitely backward state of the princesss education mme de guermantes was herself a great deal less advanced than she supposed but it was enough for her to have gone a little beyond mme de parme to stupefy that lady and as the critics of each generation confine themselves to maintaining the direct opposite of the truths admitted by their predecessors she had only to say that flaubert that archenemy of the bourgeois had been bourgeois through and through or that there was a great deal of italian music in wagner to open before the princess at the cost of a nervous exhaustion which recurred every time as before the eyes of a swimmer in a stormy sea horizons that seemed to her unimaginable and remained for ever vague a stupefaction caused also by the paradoxes uttered with relation not only to works of art but to persons of their acquaintance and to current social events no doubt the incapacity that prevented mme de parme from distinguishing the true wit of the guermantes from certain rudimentarily acquired forms of that wit which made her believe in the high intellectual worth of certain especially certain female guermantes of whom she was bewildered on hearing the duchess confide to her with a smile that they were mere blockheads was one of the causes of the astonishment which the princess always felt on hearing mme de guermantes criticise other people but there was another because also one which i who knew at this time more books than people and literature better than life explained to myself by thinking that the duchess living this wordly life the idleness and sterility of which are to a true social activity what criticism in art is to creation extended to the persons who surrounded her the instability of point of view the uneasy thirst of the reasoner who to assuage a mind that has grown too dry goes in search of no matter what paradox that is still fairly new and will make no bones about upholding the refreshing opinion that the really great iphigénie is piccinis and not glucks at a pinch the true phedre that of pradon when a woman who was intelligent educated witty had married a shy bumpkin whom one saw but seldom and never heard mme de guermantes one fine day would find a rare intellectual pleasure not only in decrying the wife but in discovering the husband in the cambremer household for example if she had lived in that section of society at the time she would have decreed that mme de cambremer was stupid and that the really interesting person misunderstood delightful condemned to silence by a chattering wife but himself worth a thousand of her was the marquis and the duchess would have felt on declaring this the same kind of refreshment as the critic who after people have for seventy years been admiring hernani confesses to a preference for le lion amoureux and from this same morbid need of arbitrary novelties if from her girlhood everyone had been pitying a model wife a true saint for being married to a scoundrel one fine day mme de guermantes would assert that this scoundrel was perhaps a frivolous man but one with a heart of gold whom the implacable harshness of his wife had driven to do the most inconsistent things i knew that it is not only over different works in the long course of centuries but over different parts of the same work that criticism plays thrusting back into the shadow what for too long has been thought brilliant and making emerge what has appeared to be doomed to permanent obscurity i had not only seen bellini winterhalter the jesuit architects a restoration cabinetmaker come to take the place of men of genius who were called worn out simply because they had worn out the lazy minds of the intellectuals as neurasthenics are always worn out and always changing i had seen preferred in saintebeuve alternately the critic and the poet musset rejected so far as his poetry went save for a few quite unimportant little pieces no doubt certain essayists are mistaken when they set above the most famous scenes in le cid or polyeucte some speech from le menteur which like an old plan furnishes information about the paris of the day but their predilection justified if not by considerations of beauty at least by a documentary interest is still too rational for our criticism run mad it will barter the whole of moliere for a line fromletourdi and even when it pronounces wagners tristan a bore will except a charming note on the horns at the point where the hunt goes by this depravation of taste helped me to understand that of which mme de guermantes gave proof when she decided that a man of their world recognised as a good fellow but a fool was a monster of egoism sharper than people thought that another widely known for his generosity might be the personification of avarice that a good mother paid no attention to her children and that a woman generally supposed to be vicious was really actuated by the noblest feelings as though spoiled by the nullity of life in society the intelligence and perception of mme de guermantes were too vacillating for disgust not to follow pretty swiftly in the wake of infatuation leaving her still ready to feel herself attracted afresh by the kind of cleverness which she had in turn sought out and abandoned and for the charm which she had felt in some warmhearted man not to change if he came too often to see her sought too freely from her directions which she was incapable of giving him into an irritation which she believed to be produced by her admirer but which was in fact due to the utter impossibility of finding pleasure when one does nothing else than seek it the variations of the duchesss judgment spared no one except her husband he alone had never been in love with her in him she had always felt an iron character indifferent to the caprices that she displayed contemptuous of her beauty violent of a will that would never bend the sort under which alone nervous people can find tranquillity m de guermantes on the other hand pursuing a single type of feminine beauty but seeking it in mistresses whom he constantly replaced had once he had left them and to express derision of them only an associate permanent and identical who irritated him often by her chatter but as to whom he knew that everyone regarded her as the most beautiful the most virtuous the cleverest the bestread member of the aristocracy as a wife whom he m de guermantes was only too fortunate to have found who cloaked all his irregularities entertained like no one else in the world and upheld for their drawingroom its position as the premier in the faubourg saintgermain this common opinion he himself shared often moved to illhumour against her he was proud of her if being as niggardly as he was fastidious he refused her the most trifling sums for her charities or for the servants yet he insisted upon her wearing the most sumptuous clothes and driving behind the best horses in paris whenever mme de guermantes had just perpetrated with reference to the merits and defects which she suddenly transposed of one of their friends a new and succulent paradox she burned to make trial of it before people capable of relishing it to bring out its psychological originality and to set its epigrammatic brilliance sparkling no doubt these new opinions embodied as a rule no more truth than the old often less but this very element arbitrary and incalculable of novelty which they contained conferred on them something intellectual which made the communication of them exciting only the patient on whom the duchess was exercising her psychological skill was generally an intimate friend as to whom those people to whom she longed to hand on her discovery were entirely unaware that he was not still at the apex of her favour thus the reputation that mme de guermantes had of being an incomparable friend sentimental tender and devoted made it difficult for her to launch the attack herself she could at the most intervene later on as though under constraint by uttering a response to appease to contradict in appearance but actually to support a partner who had taken it on himself to provoke her this was precisely the part in which m de guermantes excelled as for social activities it was yet another form of pleasure arbitrary and spectacular that mme de guermantes felt in uttering with regard to them those unexpected judgments which pricked with an incessant and exquisite feeling of surprise the princesse de parme but with this one of the duchesss pleasures it was not so much with the help of literary criticism as by following political life and the reports of parliamentary debates that i tried to understand in what it might consist the successive and contradictory edicts by which mme de guermantes continually red the scale of values among the people of her world no longer sufficing to distract her she sought also in the manner in which she ordered her own social behaviour in which she recorded her own most trivial decisions on points of fashion to taste those artificial emotions to fulfil those adventitious obligations which stimulate the perceptions of parliaments and gain hold of the minds of politicians we know that when a minister explains to the chamber that he believed himself to be acting rightly in following a line of conduct which does as a matter of fact appear quite straightforward to the commonsense person who next morning in his newspaper reads the report of the sitting this commonsense reader does nevertheless feel himself suddenly stirred and begins to doubt whether he has been right in approving the ministers conduct when he sees that the latters speech was listened to with the accompaniment of a lively agitation and punctuated with expressions of condemnation such as it is most serious ejaculated by a deputy whose name and titles are so long and followed in the report by movements so emphatic that in the whole interruption the words it is most serious occupy less room than a hemistich does in an alexandrine for instance in the days when m de guermantes prince des laumes sat in the chamber one used to read now and then in the paris newspapers albeit it was intended primarily for the méséglise division to shew the electors there that they had not given their votes to an inactive or voiceless mandatory monsieur de guermantesbouillon prince des laumes this is serious hear hear from the centre and some of the right benches loud exclamations from the extreme left the commonsense reader still retains a gleam of faith in the sage minister but his heart is convulsed with a fresh palpitation by the first words of the speaker who rises to reply the astonishment it is not too much to say the stupor keen sensation on the right side of the house that i have felt at the words of one who is still i presume a member of the government thunder of applause several undersecretaries of state for posts and telegraphs without deputies then crowded round the ministerial bench then rising from his seat nodded his head in the affirmative this thunder of applause carries away the last shred of resistance in the mind of the commonsense reader he discovers to be an insult to the chamber monstrous in fact a course of procedure which in itself is of no importance it may be some normal action such as arranging that the rich shall pay more than the poor bringing to light some piece of injustice preferring peace to war he will find it scandalous and will see in it an offence to certain principles to which as a matter of fact he had never given a thought which are not engraved on the human heart but which move him forcibly by reason of the acclamations which they provoke and the compact majorities which they assemble it must at the same time be recognised that this subtlety of the politician which served to explain to me the guermantes circle and other groups in society later on is nothing more than the perversion of a certain fineness of interpretation often described as reading between the lines if in representative assemblies there is absurdity owing to perversion of this quality there is equally stupidity through the want of it in the public who take everything literally who do not suspect a dismissal when a high dignitary is relieved of his office at his own request and say he cannot have been dismissed since it was he who asked leave to retire a defeat when the russians by a strategic movement withdraw upon a stronger position that has been prepared beforehand a refusal when a province having demanded its independence from the german emperor he grants it religious autonomy it is possible moreover to return to these sittings of the chamber that when they open the deputies themselves are like the commonsense person who will read the published report learning that certain workers on strike have sent their delegates to confer with a minister they may ask one another innocently there now i wonder what they can have been saying let us hope it is all settled at the moment when the minister himself mounts the tribune in a solemn silence which has already brought artificial emotions into play the first words of the minister there is no necessity for me to inform the chamber that i have too high a sense of what is the duty of the government to have received a deputation of which the authority entrusted to me could take no cognisance produce a dramatic effect for this was the one hypothesis which the commonsense of the deputies had not imagined but precisely because of its dramatic effect it is greeted with such applause that it is only after several minutes have passed that the minister can succeed in making himself heard the minister who will receive on returning to his place on the bench the congratulations of his colleagues we are as deeply moved as on the day when the same minister failed to invite to a big official reception the president of the municipal council who was supporting the opposition and declare that on this occasion as on the other he has acted with true statesmanship m de guermantes at this period in his life had to the great scandal of the courvoisiers frequently been among the crowd of deputies who came forward to congratulate the minister i have heard it said afterwards that even at a time when he was playing a fairly important part in the chamber and was being thought of in connexion with ministerial office or an embassy he was when a friend came to ask a favour of him infinitely more simple behaved politically a great deal less like the important political personage than anyone else who did not happen to be duc de guermantes for if he said that nobility made no difference that he regarded his fellow deputies as equals he did not believe it for a moment he sought pretended to value but really despised political importance and as he remained in his own eyes m de guermantes it did not envelop his person in that dead weight of high office which makes other politicians unapproachable and in this way his pride guarded against every assault not only his manners which were of an ostentatious familiarity but also such true simplicity as he might actually have to return to those artificial and moving decisions such as are made by politicians mme de guermantes was no less disconcerting to the guermantes the courvoisiers the faubourg in general and more than anyone the princesse de parme by her habit of issuing unaccountable decrees behind which one could feel to be latent principles which impressed one all the more the less one expected them if the new greek minister have a fancy dress ball everyone chose a costume and asked everyone else what the duchess would wear one thought that she would appear as the duchesse de bourgogne another suggested as probable the guise of princess of dujabar a third psyche finally a courvoisier having asked her what are you going to wear oriane provoked the one response of which nobody had thought why nothing at all which at once set every tongue wagging as revealing orianes opinion as to the true social position of the new greek minister and the proper attitude to adopt towards him that is to say the opinion which ought to have been foreseen namely that a duchess was not expected to attend the fancy dress bali given by this new minister i do not see that there is any necessity to go to the greek ministers i do not know him i am not a greek why should i go to these peoples house i have nothing to do with them said the duchess but everybody will be there they say it is going to be charming cried mme de gallardon still it is just as charming sometimes to sit by ones own fireside replied mme de guermantes the courvoisiers could not get over this but the guermantes without copying it approved of their cousins attitude naturally everybody is not in a position like oriane to break with all the conventions but if you look at it in one way you cannot say she was actually wrong in wishing to shew that we are going rather far in flinging ourselves at the feet of all these foreigners who appear from heaven knows where naturally knowing the stream of comment which one or other attitude would not fail to provoke mme de guermantes took as much pleasure in appearing at a party to which her hostess had not dared to count on her coming as in staying at home or spending the evening at the play with her husband on the night of a party to which everybody was going or again when people imagined that she would eclipse the finest diamonds with some historic diadem by stealing into the room without a single jewel and in another style of dress than what had been wrongly supposed to be essential to the occasion albeit she was antidreyfusard while retaining her belief in the innocence of dreyfus just as she spent her life in the social world believing only in abstract ideas she had created an enormous sensation at a party at the princesse de lignes first of all by remaining seated after all the ladies had risen to their feet as general mercier entered the room and then by getting up and in a loud voice asking for her carriage when a nationalist orator had begun to address the gathering thereby shewing that she did not consider that society was meant for talking politics all heads were turned towards her at a good friday concert at which although a voltairean she had not remained because she thought it indecent to bring christ upon the stage we know how important even for the great queens of society is that moment of the year at which the round of entertainment begins so much so that the marquise damoncourt who from a need to say something a form of mania and also from want of perception was always making a fool of herself had actually replied to somebody who had called to condole with her on the death of her father m de montmorency what makes it sadder still is that it should come at a time when ones mirror is simply stuffed with cards very well at this point in the social year when people invited the duchesse de guermantes to dinner making every effort to see that she was not already engaged she declined for the one reason of which nobody in society would ever have thought she was just starting on a cruise among the norwegian fjords which were so interesting people in society were stupefied and without any thought of following the duchesss example derived nervertheless from her action that sense of relief which one has in reading kant when after the most rigorous demonstration of determinism one finds that above the world of necessity there is the world of freedom every invention of which no one has ever thought before excites the interest even of people who can derive no benefit from it that of steam navigation was a small thing compared with the employment of steam navigation at that sedentary time of year called the season the idea that anyone could voluntarily renounce a hundred dinners or luncheons twice as many afternoon teas three times as many evening parties the most brilliant mondays at the opera and tuesdays at the français to visit the norwegian fjords seemed to the courvoisiers no more explicable than the idea of twenty thousand leagues under the sea but conveyed to them a similar impression of independence and charm so that not a day passed on which somebody might not be heard to ask not merely you have heard orianes latest joke but you know orianes latest and on orianes latest as on orianes latest joke would follow the comment how typical of oriane is not that pure oriane orianes latest might be for instance that having to write on behalf of a patriotic society to cardinal x bishop of macon whom m de guermantes when he spoke of him invariably called monsieur de mascon thinking this to be old french when everyone was trying to imagine what form the letter would take and had no difficulty as to the opening words the choice lying between eminence and monseigneur but was puzzled as to the rest orianes letter to the general astonishment began monsieur le cardinal following an old academic form or my cousin this term being in use among the princes of the church the gsermantes and crowned heads who prayed to god to take each and all of them into his fit and holy keeping to start people on the topic of an orianes latest it was sufficient that at a performance at which all paris was present and a most charming play was being given when they looked for mme de guermantes in the boxes of the princesse de parme the princesse de guermantes countless other ladies who had invited her they discovered her sitting by herself in black with a tiny hat on her head in a stall in which she had arrived before the curtain rose you hear better when it is a play that is worth listening to she explained to the scandal of the courvoisiers and the admiring bewilderment of the guermantes and the princesse de parme who suddenly discovered that the fashion of hearing the beginning of a play was more up to date was a proof of greater originality and intelligence which need not astonish them coming from oriane than that of arriving for the last act after a big dinnerparty and going on somewhere first such were the various kinds of surprise for which the princesse de parme knew that she ought to be prepared if she put a literary or social question to mme de guermantes one result of which was that during these dinnerparties at orianes her royal highness never ventured upon the slightest topic save with the uneasy and enraptured prudence of the bather emerging from between two breakers among the elements which absent from the three or four other more or less equivalent drawingrooms that set the fashion for the faubourg saintgermain differentiated from them that of the duchesse de guermantes just as leibniz allows that each monad while reflecting the entire uni adds to it something of its own one of the least attractive was regularly furnished by one or two extremely goodlooking women who had no title to be there apart from their beauty and the use that m de guermantes had made of them and whose presence revealed at once as does in other drawingrooms that of certain otherwise unaccountable pictures that in this household the husband was an ardent appreciator of feminine graces they were all more or less alike for the duke had a taste for large women at once statuesque and looselimbed of a type halfway between the venus of milo and the samothracian victory often fair rarely dark sometimes auburn like the most recent who was at this dinner that vicomtesse darpajon whom he had loved so well that for a long time he had obliged her to send him as many as ten telegrams daily which slightly annoyed the duchess corresponded with her by carrier pigeon when he was at guermantes and from whom moreover he had long been so incapable of tearing himself away that one winter which he had had to spend at parma he travelled back regularly every week to paris spending two days in the train in order to see her as a rule these handsome supers had been his mistresses but were no longer as was mme darpajons case or were on the point of ceasing to be so it may well have been that the importance which the duchess enjoyed in their sight and the hope of being invited to her house though they themselves came of thoroughly aristocratic but still not quite firstclass stock had prompted them even more than the good looks and generosity of the duke to yield to his desires not that the duchess would have placed any insuperable obstacle in the way of their crossing her threshold she was aware that in more than one of them she had found an ally thanks to whom she had obtained a thousand things which she wanted but which m de guermantes pitilessly denied his wife so long as he was not in love with some one else and so the reason why they were not invited by the duchess until their intimacy with the duke was already far advanced lay principally in the fact that he every time that he had embarked on the deep waters of love had imagined nothing more than a brief flirtation as a reward for which he considered an invitation from his wife to be more than adequate and yet he found himself offering this as the price of far less for a first kiss in fact because a resistance upon which he had never reckoned had been brought into play or because there had been no resistance in love it often happens that gratitude the desire to give pleasure makes us generous beyond the limits of what the other persons expectation and selfinterest could have anticipated but then the realisation of this offer was hindered by conflicting circumstances in the first place all the women who had responded to m de guermantess love and sometimes even when they had not yet surrendered themselves to him he had one after another segregated from the world he no longer allowed them to see anyone spent almost all his time in their company looked after the education of their children to whom now and again if one was to judge by certain speaking likenesses later on he had occasion to present a little brother or sister and so if at the start of the connexion the prospect of an introduction to mme de guermantes which had never crossed the mind of the duke had entered considerably into the thoughts of his mistress their connexion had by itself altered the whole of the ladys point of view the duke was no longer for her merely the husband of the smartest woman in paris but a man with whom his new mistress was in love a man moreover who had given her the means and the inclination for a more luxurious style of living and had transposed the relative importance in her mind of questions of social and of material advantage while now and then a composite jealousy into which all these factors entered of mme de guermantes animated the dukes mistresses but this case was the rarest of all besides when the day appointed for the introduction at length arrived at a point when as a rule the duke had lost practically all interest in the matter his actions like everyone is else being generally dictated by previous actions the prime motive of which had already ceased to exist it frequently happened that it was mme de guermantes who had sought the acquaintance of the mistress in whom she hoped and so greatly needed to discover against her dread husband a valuable ally this is not to say that save at rare moments in their own house where when the duchess talked too much he let fall a few words or more dreadful still preserved a silence which rendered her speechless m de guermantes failed in his outward relations with his wife to observe what are called the forms people who did not know them might easily misunderstand sometimes between the racing at deauville the course of waters and the return to guermantes for the shooting in the few weeks which people spend in paris since the duchess had a liking for caféconcerts the duke would go with her to spend the evening at one of these the audience remarked at once in one of those little open boxes in which there is just room for two this hercules in his smoking for in france we give to everything that is more or less british the one name that it happens not to bear in england his monocle screwed in his eye in his plump but finely shaped hand on the ringfinger of which there glowed a sapphire a plump cigar from which now and then he drew a puff of smoke keeping his eyes for the most part on the stage but when he did let them fall upon the audience in which there was absolutely no one whom he knew softening them with an air of gentleness reserve courtesy and consideration when a struck him as amusing and not too indecent the duke would turn round with a smile to his wife letting her share by a twinkle of goodnatured understanding the innocent merriment which the new song had aroused in himself and the spectators might believe that there was no better husband in the world than this nor anyone more enviable than the duchess that woman outside whom every interest in the dukes life lay that woman with whom he was not in love to whom he had been consistently unfaithful when the duchess felt tired they saw m de guermantes rise put on her cloak with his own hands arranging her necklaces so that they did not catch in the lining and clear a path for her to the street with an assiduous and respectful attention which she received with the coldness of the woman of the world who sees in such behaviour simply conventional politeness at times even with the slightly ironical bitterness of the disabused spouse who has no illusion left to shatter but despite these externals another element of that politeness which has made duty evolve from the depths of our being to the surface at a period already remote but still continuing for its survivors the life of the duchess was by no means easy m de guermantes never became generous or human save for a new mistress who would take as it generally happened the duchesss part the latter saw becoming possible for her once again generosities towards inferiors charities to the poor even for herself later on a new and sumptuous motorcar but from the irritation which developed as a rule pretty rapidly in mme de guermantes at people whom she found too submissive the dukes mistresses were not exempt presently the duchess grew tired of them simultaneously at this moment the dukes intimacy with mme darpajon was drawing to an end another mistress dawned on the horizon no doubt the love which m de guermantes had had for each of them in succession would begin one day to make itself felt afresh in the first place this love in dying bequeathed them like beautiful marbles marbles beautiful to the duke become thus in part an artist because he had loved them and was sensitive now to lines which he would not have appreciated without love which brought into juxtaposition in the duchesss drawingroom their forms long inimical devoured by jealousies and quarrels and finally reconciled in the peace of friendship besides this friendship itself was an effect of the love which had made m de guermantes observe in those who were his mistresses virtues which exist in every human being but are perceptible only to the sensual eye so much so that the exmistress become the best of comrades who would do anything in the world for one is as recognised a type as the doctor or father who is not a doctor or a father but a friend but during a period of transition the woman whom m de guermantes was preparing to abandon bewailed her lot made scenes shewed herself exacting appeared indiscreet became a nuisance the duke began to take a dislike to her then mme de guermantes had an opportunity to bring into prominence the real or imagined defects of a person who annoyed her known as a kind woman mme de guermantes received the telephone messages the confidences the tears of the abandoned mistress and made no complaint she laughed at them first with her husband then with a few chosen friends and imagining that this pity which she shewed for the poor wretch gave her the right to make fun of her even to her face whatever the lady might say provided it could be included among the attributes of the character for absurdity which the puke and duchess had recently fabricated for her mme de guermantes had no hesitation in exchanging with her husband a glance of ironical connivance meanwhile as she sat down to table the princesse de parme remembered that she had thought of inviting a certain other princess to the opera and wishing to be assured that this would not in any way offend mme de guermantes was preparing to sound her at this moment there entered m de grouchy whose train owing to some block on the line had been held up for an hour he made what excuses he could his wife had she been a courvoisier would have died of shame but mme de grouchy was not a guermantes for nothing as her husband was apologising for being late i see she broke in that even in little things arriving late is a tradition in your family sit down grouchy and do not let them pull your leg said the duke i hope i move with the times still i must admit that the battle of waterloo had its points since it brought about the restoration of the bourbons and better still in a way which made them unpopular but you seem to be a regular nimrod well as a matter of fact i have had quite a good bag i shall take the liberty of sending the duchess six brace of pheasants tomorrow an idea seemed to flicker in the eyes of mme de guermantes she insisted that m de grouchy must not give himself the trouble of sending the pheasants and making a sign to the betrothed footman with whom i had exchanged a few words on my way from the elstir room poullein she told him you will go tomorrow and fetch m le comtes pheasants and bring them straight back you will not mind will you grouchy if i make a few little presents basin and i cannot eat a whole dozen by ourselves but the day after tomorrow will be soon enough said m de grouchy no tomorrow suits me better the duchess insisted poullein had turned pale his appointment with his sweetheart would have to be missed this was quite enough for the diversion of the duchess who liked to appear to be taking a human interest in everyone i know it is your day out she went on to poullein all you have got to do is to change with georges he can take tomorrow off and stay in the day after but the day after poulleins sweetheart would not be free a holiday then was of no account to him as soon as he was out of the room everyone complimented the duchess on the interest she took in her servants but i only behave towards them as i like people to behave to me that is just it they can say they have found a good place with you oh nothing so very wonderful but i think they all like me that one is a little annoying because he is in love he thinks it incumbent on him to go about with a long face at this point poullein reappeared you are quite right said m de grouchy he does not look much like smiling with those fellows one has to be good but not too good i admit i am not a very dreadful mistress he will have nothing to do all day but call for your pheasants sit in the house doing nothing and eat his share of them there are plenty of people who would be glad to be in his place said m de grouchy for envy makes men blind oriane began the princesse de parme i had a visit the other day from your cousin heudicourt of course she is a highly intelligent woman she is a guermantes one can say no more but they tell me she has a spitel ful tongue the duke fastened on his wife a slow gaze of deliberate stupefaction mme de guermantes began to smile gradually the princess became aware of their pantomime but do you mean to say you do not agree with me she stammered with growing uneasiness really madam it is too good of you to pay any attention to basins faces now basin you are not to hint nasty things about our cousins he thinks her too wicked inquired the princess briskly oh dear me no replied the duchess i do not know who told your highness that she was spiteful on the contrary she is an excellent creature who never said any harm of anyone or did any harm to any one ah sighed mme de parme greatly relieved i must say i never noticed anything myself but i know it is often difficult not to be a little spiteful when one is so full of wit ah now that is a quality of which she has even less less wit asked the stupefied princess come now oriane broke in the duke in a plaintive tone casting to right and left of him a glance of amusement you heard the princess tell you that she was a superior woman but is not she superior in chest measurement at any rate do not listen to him madam he is not sincere she is as stupid as a hm goose came in a loud and rasping voice from mme de guermantes who a great deal more old french even than the duke when he was not trying did often deliberately seek to be but in a manner the opposite of the laceneckcloth deliquescent style of her husband and in reality far more subtle by a sort of almost peasant pronunciation which had a harsh and delicious flavour of the soil but she is the best woman in the world besides i do not really know that one can call it stupidity when it is carried to such a point as that i do not believe i ever met anyone quite like her she is a case for a specialist there is something pathological about her she is a sort of innocent or cretin or an arrested development like the people you see in melodramas or in larlésienne i always ask myself when she comes to see me whether the moment may not have arrived at which her intelligence is going to dawn which makes me a little nervous always the princess was lost in admiration of these utterances but remained stupefied by the preceding verdict she repeated to me and so did mme depinay what you said about teaser augustus it is delicious she put in m de guermantes explained the joke to me i wanted to tell him that his brother who pretended not to know me was expecting me that same evening at eleven of the clock but i had not asked robert whether i might mention this engagement and as the fact that m de charlus had practically fixed it with me himself directly contradicted what he had told the duchess i judged it more tactful to say nothing teaser augustus was not bad said m de guermantes but mme dheudicourt probably did not tell you a far better thing that oriane said to her the other day in reply to an invitation to luncheon no indeed do tell me now basin you keep quiet in the first place it was a stupid remark and it will make the princess think me inferior even to my fool of a cousin though i do not know why i should call her my cousin she is one of basins cousins still i believe she is related to me in some sort of way oh cried the princesse de parme at the idea that she could possibly think mme de guermantes stupid and protesting helplessly that nothing could ever lower the duchess from the place she held in her estimation besides we have already subtracted from her the quality of wit as what i said to her tends to deny her certain other good qualities also it seems to me inopportune to repeat it deny her inopportune how well she expresses herself said the duke with a pretence of irony to win admiration for the duchess now then basin you are not to make fun of your wife i should explain to your royal highness went on the duke that orianes cousin may be superior good stout anything you like to mention but she is not exactly what shall i say lavish no i know she is terribly closefisted broke in the princess i should not have ventured to use the expression but you have hit on exactly the right word you can see it in her housekeeping and especially in the cooking which is excellent but strictly rationed which leads to some quite amusing scenes m de bréauté interrupted him for instance my dear basin i was down at heudicourt one day when you were expected oriane and yourself they had made the most elaborate preparations when during the afternoon a footman brought in a telegram to say that you were not coming that does not surprise me said the duchess who not only was difficult to secure but liked people to know as much your cousin read the telegram was duly distressed then immediately without losing her head telling herself that there was no point in going to unnecessary expense for so unimportant a gentleman as myself called the footman back tell the cook not to put on the chicken she shouted after him and that evening i heard her asking the butler well what about the beef that was left over yesterday are not you going to let us have that all the same one must admit that the cheer you get there is of the very best said the duke who fancied that in using this language he shewed himself to belong to the old school i do not know any house where one gets better food or less put in the duchess it is quite wholesome and quite enough for what you would call a vulgar yokel like myself went on the duke one keeps ones appetite oh if it is to be taken as a cure it is certainly more hygienic than sumptuous not that it is as good as all that added mme de guermantes who was not at all pleased that the title of best table in paris should be awarded to any but her own with my cousin it is just the same as with those costive authors who hatch out every fifteen years a oneact play or a sonnet the sort of thing people call a little masterpiece trifles that are perfect gems in fact the one thing i loathe most in the world the cooking at zénaides is not bad but you would think it more ordinary if she was less parsimonious there are some things her cook does quite well and others that he spoils i have had some thoroughly bad dinners there as in most houses only they have done me less harm there because the stomach is after all more sensitive to quantity than to quality well to get on with the story the duke concluded zénaide insisted that oriane should go to luncheon there and as my wife is not very fond of going out anywhere she resisted wanted to be sure that under the pretence of a quiet meal she was not being trapped into some great banquet and tried in vain to find out who else were to be of the party you must come zénaide insisted boasting of all the good things there would be to eat you are going to have a purée of chestnuts i need say no more than that and there will be seven littlebouchées a la reine seven little bouchées cried oriane that means that we shall be at least eightl there was silence for a few seconds and then the princess having seen the point let her laughter explode like a peal of thunder ah then we shall be eight it is exquisite how very well phrased she said having by a supreme effort recaptured the expression she had heard used by mme depinay which this time was more appropriate oriane that was very charming of the princess she said your remark was well phrased but my dear you are telling me nothing new i know how clever the princess is replied mme de guermantes who readily assimilated a remark when it was uttered at once by a royal personage and in praise of her own wit i am very proud that madam should appreciate my humble phrasings i do not remember though that i ever did say such a thing and if i did it must have been to flatter my cousin for if she had ordered seven mouthfuls the mouths if i may so express myself would have been a round dozen if not more she used to have all m de borniers manuscripts went on the princess still speaking of mme dheudicourt and anxious to make the most of the excellent reasons she might have for associating with that lady she must have dreamed it i do not believe she ever even know him said the duchess what is really interesting about him is that he kept up a correspondence with people of different nationalities at the same time put in the vicomtesse darpajon who allied to the principal ducal and even reigning families of europe was always glad that people should be reminded of the fact surely oriane said m de guermantes with ulterior purpose you cannot have forgotten that dinnerparty where you had m de bornier sitting next to you but basin the duchess interrupted him if you mean to inform me that i knew m de bornier why of course i did he even called upon me several times but i could never bring myself to invite him to the house because i should always have been obliged to have it disinfected afterwards with formol as for the dinner you mean i remember it only too well but it was certainly not at zénaides who never set eyes on bornier in her life and would probably think if you spoke to her of the fille de roland that you meant a bonaparte princess who was said at one time to be engaged to the son of the king of greece no it was at the austrian embassy dear hoyos imagined he was giving me a great treat by planting on the chair next to mine that pestiferous academician i quite thought i had a squadron of mounted police sitting beside me i was obliged to stop my nose as best i could all through dinner until the gruyere came round i did not dare to breathe m de guermantes whose secret object was attained made a furtive examination of his guests faces to judge the effect of the duchesss pleasantry you were speaking of correspondence i must say i thought gambettas admirable she went on to shew that she was not afraid to be found taking an interest in a proletarian and a radical m de bréauté who fully appreciated the brilliance of this feat of daring gazed round him with an eye at once flashing and affectionate after which he wiped his monocle gad it is infernally dull that fille de roland said m de guermantes with the satisfaction which he derived from the sense of his own superiority to a work which had bored him so perhaps also from the suave mari magno feeling one has in the middle of a good dinner when one recalls so terrible an evening in the past still there were some quite good lines in it and a patriotic sentiment i let it be understood that i had no admiration for m de bornier indeed you have some fault to find with him the duke asked with a note of curiosity for he always imagined when anyone spoke ill of a man that it must be on account of a personal resentment just as to speak well of a woman marked the beginning of a loveaffair i see you have got your knife into him what did he do to you you must tell us why yes there must be some skeleton in the cupboard or you would not run him down it is longwinded the fille de roland but it is quite strong in parts strong is just the right word for an author who smelt like that mme de guermantes broke in sarcastically if this poor boy ever found himself face to face with him i can quite understand that he carried away an impression in his nostrils i must confess though to madam the duke went on addressing the princesse de parme that quite apart from thefille de roland in literature and even in music i am terribly oldfashioned no old nightingale can be too stale for my taste you will not believe me perhaps but in the evenings if my wife sits down to the piano i find myself calling for some old tune by auber or boieldieu or even beethoven that is the sort of thing that appeals to me as for wagner he sends me to sleep at once you are wrong there said mme de guermantes in spite of his insufferable longwindedness wagner was a genius lohengrin is a masterpiece even in tristan there are some amusing passages scattered about and the of spinners in the flying dutchman is a perfect marvel ant i right babal said m de guermantes turning to m de bréauté what we like is les rendezvous de noble compagnie se donnent tous en ce charmant séjour it is delicious and fra diavolo and the magic flute and the chalet and the marriage of figaro and the diamants de la couronne there is music for you it is the same thing in literature for instance i adore balzac thebal de sceaux the mohicans de paris oh my dear if you are going to begin about balzac we shall never hear the end of it do wait keep it for some evening when mémés here he is even better he knows it all by heart irritated by his wifes interruption the duke held her for some seconds under the fire of a menacing silence and his huntsmans eyes reminded me of a brace of loaded pistols meanwhile mme darpajon had been exchanging with the princesse de parme upon tragic and other kinds of poetry a series of remarks which did not reach me distinctly until i caught the following from mme darpajon oh madam is sure to be right i quite admit he makes the world seem ugly because he is unable to distinguish between ugliness and beauty or rather because his insufferable vanity makes him believe that everything he says is beautiful i agree with your highness that in the piece we are speaking of there are some ridiculous things quite unintelligible errors of taste that it is difficult to understand that it is as much trouble to read as if it was written in russian or chinese for of course it is anything in the world but french still when one has taken the trouble how richly one is rewarded it is so full of imagination of this little lecture i had missed the opening sentences i gathered in the end not only that the poet incapable of distinguishing between beauty and ugliness was victor hugo but furthermore that the poem which was as difficult to understand as chinese or russian was lorsque lenfant paraît le cercle de famille applaudit a grands cris a piece dating from the poets earliest period and perhaps even nearer to mme deshoulieres than to the victor hugo of the légende des siecles far from condemning mme darpajon as absurd i saw her the only one at that table so matteroffact so nondescript at which i had sat down with such keen disappointment i saw her in my minds eye crowned with that lace cap with the long spiral ringlets falling from it on either side which was worn by mme de rémusat mme de broglie mme de saintaularie all those distinguished women who in their fascinating letters quote with so much learning and so aptly passages from sophocles schiller and theimitation but in whom the earliest poetry of the romantics induced the alarm and exhaustion inseparable for my grandmother from the latest s of stéphane mallarmé mme darpajon is very fond of poetry said the princesse de parme to her hostess impressed by the ardent tone in which the speech had been delivered no she knows absolutely nothing about it replied mme de guermantes in an undertone taking advantage of the fact that mme darpajon who was dealing with an objection raised by general de beautreillis was too much intent upon what she herself was saying to hear what was being murmured by the duchess she has become literary since she is been forsaken i can tell your highness that it is i who have to bear the whole burden of it because it is to me that she comes in floods of tears whenever basin has not been to see her which is practically every day and yet it is not my fault after all if she bores him and i cannot force him to go to her although i would rather he were a little more faithful to her because then i should not see quite so much of her myself but she drives him crazy and there is nothing extraordinary in that she is not a bad sort but she is boring to a degree you cannot imagine and all this because basin took it into his head for a year or so to play me false with her and to have in addition a footman who has fallen in love with a little streetwalker and goes about with a long face if i do not request the young person to leave her profitable pavement for half an hour and come to tea with me oh life really is too tedious the duchess languorously concluded mme darpajon bored m de guermantes principally because he had recently fallen in love with another whom i discovered to be the marquise de surgisleduc at this moment the footman who had been deprived of his holiday was waiting at table and it struck me that still disconsolate he was doing it with a good deal of difficulty for i noticed that in handing the dish to m de châtellerault he performed his task so awkwardly that the dukes elbow came in contact several times with his own the young duke was not in the least annoyed with the blushing footman but looked up at him rather with a smile in his clear blue eyes this good humour seemed to me on the guests part to betoken a kindness of heart but the persistence of his smile led me to think that aware of the servants discomfiture what he felt was perhaps really a malicious joy but my dear you know you are not revealing any new discovery when you tell us about victor hugo went on the duchess this time addressing mme darpajon whom she had just seen turn away from the general with a troubled air you must not expect to launch that young genius everybody knows that he has talent what is utterly detestable is the victor hugo of the last stage the légende des siecles i forget all their names but in the feuilles dautomne the chants du crépuscule there is a great deal that is the work of a poet a true poet even in thecontemplations went on the duchess whom none of her listeners dared to contradict and with good reason there are still some quite pretty things but i confess that i prefer not to venture farther than thecrepuscule and then in the finer poems of victor hugo and there really are some one frequently comes across an idea even a profound idea and with the right shade of sentiment bringing out the sorrowful thought with the full strength of her intonation planting it somewhere beyond the sound of her voice and fixing straight in front of her a charming dreamy gaze the duchess said slowly take this la douleur est un fruit dieu ne le fait pas croître sur la branche trop faible encor pour le porter or better still les morts durent bien peu hélas dans le cercueil ils tombent en poussiere moins vite quen nos coeurs and while a smile of disillusionment contracted with a graceful undulation her sorrowing lips the duchess fastened on mme darpajon the dreaming gaze of her charming clear blue eyes i was beginning to know them as well as her voice with its heavy drawl its harsh savour in those eyes and in that voice i recognised much of the life of nature round combray certainly in the affectation with which that voice brought into prominence at times a rudeness of the soil there was more than one element the wholly provincial origin of one branch of the guermantes family which had for long remained more localised more hardy wilder more provoking than the rest and also the usage of really distinguished people and of witty people who know that distinction does not consist in mincing speech and the usage of nobles who fraternise more readily with their peasants than with the middle classes peculiarities all of which the regal position of mme de guermantes enabled her to display more easily to bring out with every sail spread it appears that the same voice existed also in certain of her sisters whom she detested and who less intelligent than herself and almost plebeianly married if one may coin this adverb to speak of unions with obscure noblemen entrenched on their provincial estates or in paris in a faubourg saintgermain of no brilliance possessed this voice also but had bridled it corrected it softened it so far as lay in their power just as it is very rarely that any of us presumes on his own originality and does not apply himself diligently to copying the most approved models but oriane was so much more intelligent so much richer above all so much more in fashion than her sisters she had so effectively when princesse des laumes behaved just as she pleased in the company of the prince of wales that she had realised that this discordant voice was an attraction and had made of it in the social order with the courage of originality rewarded by success what in the theatrical order a réjane a jeanne granier which implies no comparison naturally between the respective merits and talents of those two actresses had made of theirs something admirable and distinctive which possibly certain réjane and granier sisters whom no one has ever known strove to conceal as a defect to all these reasons for displaying her local originality the favourite writers of mme de guermantes mérimée meilhac and halévy had brought in addition with the respect for what was natural a feeling for the prosaic by which she attained to poetry and a spirit purely of society which called up distant landscapes before my eyes besides the duchess was fully capable adding to these influences an artistic research of her own of having chosen for the majority of her words the pronunciation that seemed to her most he de france most champenoise since if not quite to the same extent as her sisterinlaw marsantes she rarely used anything but the pure vocabulary that might have been employed by an old french writer and when one was tired of the composite patchwork of modern speech it was albeit one was aware that she expressed far fewer ideas a thorough relaxation to listen to the talk of mme de guermantes almost the same feeling if one was alone with her and she restrained and clarified still further her flow of words as one has on hearing an old song then as i looked at as i listened to mme de guermantes i could see a prisoner in the perpetual and quiet afternoon of her eyes a sky of the he de france or of champagne spread itself greyblue oblique with the same angle of inclination as in the eyes of saintloup thus by these several formations mme de guermantes expressed at once the most ancient aristocratic france then from a far later source the manner in which the duchesse de broglie might have enjoyed and found fault with victor hugo under the july monarchy and finally a keen taste for the literature that sprang from mérimée and meilhac the first of these formations attracted me more than the second did more to console me for the disappointments of my pilgrimage to and arrival in the faubourg saintgermain so different from what i had imagined it to be but even the second i preferred to the last for so long as mme de guermantes was being almost spontaneously a guermantes and nothing more her pailleronism her taste for the younger dumas were reflected and deliberate as this taste was the opposite of my own she was productive to my mind of literature when she talked to me of the faubourg saintgermain and never seemed to me so stupidly faubourg saintgermain as when she was talking literature moved by this last quotation mme darpajon exclaimed ces reliques du coeur ont aussi leur poussiere sir you must write that down for me on my fan she said to m de guermantes poor woman i feel sorry for her said the princesse de parme to mme de guermantes no really madam you must not be softhearted she has only got what she deserves but you will forgive me for saying this to you she does really love him all the same oh not at all she is not capable of it she thinks she loves him just as she thought just now she was quoting victor hugo when she repeated a line from musset listen the duchess went on in a tone of melancholy nobody would be more touched than myself by any true sentiment but let me give you an instance only yesterday she made a terrible scene with basin your highness thinks perhaps that it was because he is in love with other women because he no longer loves her not in the least it was because he will not put her sons down for the jockey does madam call that the behaviour of a woman in love no i will go farther mme de guermantes added with precision she is a person of singular insensibility meanwhile it was with an eye sparkling with satisfaction that m de guermantes had listened to his wife talking about victor hugo pointblank and quoting his poetry the duchess might frequently annoy him at moments like this he was proud of her oriane is really extraordinary she can talk about anything she has read everything she could not possibly have guessed that the conversation this evening would turn on victor hugo whatever subject you take up she is ready for you she can hold her own with the most learned scholars this young man must be quite captivated do let us change the conversation mme de guermantes went on because she is dreadfully susceptible you will think me quite oldfashioned she began turning to me i know that nowadays it is considered a weakness to care for ideas in poetry poetry with some thought in it oldfashioned asked the princesse de parme quivering with the slight thrill sent through her by this new wave which she had not expected albeit she knew that the conversation of the duchesse de guermantes always held in store for her these continuous and delightful shocks that breathcatching panic that wholesome exhaustion after which her thoughts instinctively turned to the necessity of taking a footbath in a dressing cabin and a brisk walk to restore her circulation for my part no oriane said mme de brissac i do not in the least object to victor hugos having ideas quite the contrary but i do object to his seeking for them in sheer monstrosities after all it was he who accustomed us to ugliness in literature there are quite enough ugly things already in real life why cannot we be allowed at least to forget it while we are reading a distressing spectacle from which we should turn away in real life that is what attracts victor hugo victor hugo is not as realistic as zola though surely asked the princesse de parme the name of zola did not stir a muscle on the face of m de beautreillis the generals antidreyfusism was too deeprooted for him to seek to give expression to it and his goodnatured silence when anyone broached these topics moved the profane heart as a proof of the same delicacy that a priest shews in avoiding any reference to your religious duties a financier when he takes care not to recommend your investing in the companies which he himself controls a strong man when he behaves with lamblike gentleness and does not hit you in the jaw i know you are related to admiral jurien de la graviere was murmured to me with an air of connivance by mme de varambon the lady in waiting to the princesse de parme an excellent but limited woman procured for the princess in the past by the dukes mother she had not previously uttered a word to me and i could never afterwards despite the admonitions of the princess and my own protestations get out of her mind the idea that i was in some way connected with the academician admiral who was a complete stranger to me the obstinate persistence of the princesse de parmes lady in waiting in seeing in me a nephew of admiral jurien de la graviere was in itself quite an ordinary form of silliness but the mistake she made was only a crowning instance of all the other mistakes less serious more elaborate unconscious or deliberate which accompany ones name on the label which society writes out and attaches to one i remember that a friend of the guermantes who had expressed a keen desire to meet me gave me as the reason that i was a great friend of his cousin mme de chaussegros she is a charming person she is so fond of you i scrupulously though quite vainly insisted on the fact that there must be some mistake as i did not know mme de chaussegros then it is her sister you know it comes to the same thing she met you in scotland i had never been in scotland and took the futile precaution in my honesty of letting my informant know this it was mme de chaussegros herself who had said that she knew me and no doubt sincerely believed it as a result of some initial confusion for from that time onwards she never failed to hold out her hand to me whenever she saw me and as after all the world in which i moved was precisely that in which mme de chaussegros moved my modesty had neither rhyme nor reason to say that i was intimate with the chaussegros was literally a mistake but from the social point of view was to state an equivalent of my position if one can speak of the social position of so young a man as i then was it therefore mattered not in the least that this friend of the guermantes should tell me only things that were false about myself he neither lowered nor exalted me from the worldly point of view in the idea which he continued to hold of me and when all is said for those of us who are not professional actors the tedium of living always in the same character is removed for a moment as if we were to go on the boards when another person forms a false idea of us imagines that we are friends with a lady whom we do not know and are reported to have met in the course of a delightful tour of a foreign country which we have never made errors that multiply themselves and are harmless when they have not the inflexible rigidity of this one which had been committed and continued for the rest of her life to be committed in spite of my denials by the imbecile lady in waiting to mme de parme rooted for all time in the belief that i was related to the tiresome admiral jurien de la graviere she is not very strong in her head the duke confided to me and besides she ought not to indulge in too many libations i fancy she is slightly under the influence of bacchus as a matter of fact mme de varambon had drunk nothing but water but the duke liked to find scope for his favourite figures of speech but zola is not a realist madam he is a poet said mme de guermantes drawing inspiration from the critical essays which she had read in recent years and adapting them to her own personal genius agreeably buffeted hitherto in the course of this bath of wit a bath stirred for herself which she was taking this evening and which she considered must be particularly good for her health letting herself be swept away by the waves of paradox which curled and broke one after another before this the most enormous of them all the princesse de parme jumped for fear of being knocked over and it was in a choking voice as though she were quite out of breath that she now gasped zola a poet why yes answered the duchess with a laugh entranced by this display of suffocation your highness must have remarked how he magnifies everything he touches you will tell me that he touches just what perish the thought but he makes it into something colossal his is the epic dungheap he is the homer of the sewers he has not enough capitals to print cambronnes word despite the extreme exhaustion which she was beginning to feel the princess was enchanted never had she felt better she would not have exchanged for an invitation to schonbrunn albeit that was the one thing that really flattered her these divine dinnerparties at mme de guermantess made invigorating by so liberal a dose of attic salt he writes it with a big c cried mme darpajon surely with a big m i think my dear replied mme de guermantes exchanging first with her husband a merry glance which implied did you ever hear such an idiot wait a minute now mme de guermantes turned to me fixing on me a tender smiling gaze because as an accomplished hostess she was anxious to display her own knowledge of the artist who interested me specially to give me if i required it an opportunity for exhibiting mine wait she urged me gently waving her feather fan so conscious was she at this moment that she was performing in full the duties of hospitality and that she might be found wanting in none of them making a sign also to the servants to help me to more of the asparagus and mousseline sauce wait now i do believe that zola has actually written an essay on elstir the painter whose things you were looking at just now the only ones of his really that i care for she concluded as a matter of fact sh hated elstirs work but found a unique quality in anything that was in her own house i asked m de guermantes if he knew the name of the gentleman in the tall hat who figured in the picture of the crowd and whom i recognised as the same person whose portrait the guermantes also had and had hung beside the other both dating more or less from the same early period in which elstirs personality was not yet completely established and he derived a certain inspiration from manet good lord yes he replied i know it is a fellow who is quite wellknown and no fool either in his own line but i have no head for names i have it on the tip of my tongue monsieur monsieur oh well it does not matter i cannot remember it swann would be able to tell you it was he who made mme de guermantes buy all that stuff she is always too goodnatured afraid of hurting peoples feelings if she refuses to do things between ourselves i believe he is landed us with a lot of rubbish what i can tell you is that the gentleman you mean has been a sort of maecenas to m elstir he started him and has often helped him out of tight places by ordering pictures from him as a compliment to this man if you can call that sort of thing a compliment he has painted him standing about among that crowd where with his sundaygotomeeting look he creates a distinctly odd effect he may be a big gun in his own way but he is evidently not aware of the proper time and place for a top hat with that thing on his head among all those bareheaded girls he looks like a little country lawyer on the razzledazzle but tell me you seem quite gone on his pictures if i had only known i should have got up the subject properly not that there is any need to rack ones brains over the meaning of m elstirs work as one would for ingress source or the princes in the towier by paul delaroche what one appreciates in his work is that it is shrewdly observed amusing parisian and then one passes on to the next thing one does not need to be an expert to look at that sort of thing i know of course that they are merely sketches still i do not feel myself that he puts enough work into them swann was determined that we should buy abundle of asparagus in fact it was in the house for several days there was nothing else in the picture a bundle of asparagus exactly like what you are eating now but i must say i declined to swallow m elstirs asparagus he asked three hundred francs for them three hundred francs for a bundle of asparagus a louis that is as much as they are worth even if they are out of season i thought it a bit stiff when he puts real people into his pictures as well there is something rather caddish something detrimental about him which does not appeal to me i am surprised to see a delicate mind a superior brain like yours admire that sort of thing i do not know why you should say that basin interrupted the duchess who did not like to hear people run down anything that her rooms contained i am by no means prepared to admit that there is nothing distinguished in elstirs pictures you have to take it or leave it but it is not always lacking in talent and you must admit that the ones i bought are singularly beautiful well oriane in that style of thing i would a thousand times rather have the little study by m vibert we saw at the watercolour exhibition there is nothing much in it if you like you could take it in the palm of your hand but you can see the mans clever through and through that unwashed scarecrow of a missionary standing before the sleek prelate who is making his little dog do tricks it is a perfect little poem of subtlety and in fact goes really deep i believe you know m elstir the duchess went on to me as a man he is quite pleasant he is intelligent said the duke one is surprised when one talks to him that his painting should be so vulgar he is more than intelligent he is really quite clever said the duchess in the confidently critical tone of a person who knew what she was talking about did not he once start a portrait of you oriane asked the princesse de parme yes in shrimp pink replied mme de guermantes but that is not going to hand his name down to posterity it is a ghastly thing basin wanted to have it destroyed this last statement was one which mme de guermantes often made but at other times her appreciation of the picture was different i do not care for his painting but he did once do a good portrait of me the former of these judgments was addressed as a rule to people who spoke to the duchess of her portrait the other to those who did not refer to it and whom therefore she was anxious to inform of its existence the former was inspired in her by coquetry the latter by vanity make a portrait of you look ghastly why then it cannot be a portrait it is a falsehood i do not know one end of a brush from the other but i am sure if i were to paint you merely putting you down as i see you i should produce a masterpiece said the princesse de parme ingenuously he sees me probably as i see myself without any allurements said the duchesse de guermantes with the look melancholy modest and coaxing which seemed to her best calculated to make her appear different from what elstir had portrayed that portrait ought to appeal to mme de gallardon said the duke because she knows nothing about pictures asked the princesse de parme who knew that mme de guermantes had an infinite contempt for her cousin but she is a very good woman is not she the duke assumed an air of profound astonishment why basin do not you see the princess is making fun of you the princess had never dreamed of doing such a thing she knows as well as you do that gallardonette is an old poison went on mme de guermantes whose vocabulary limited as a rule to all these old expressions was as savoury as those dishes which it is possible to come across in the delicious books of pampille but which have in real life become so rare dishes where the jellies the butter the gravy the quails are all genuine permit of no alloy where even the salt is brought specially from the saltmarshes of brittany from her accent her choice of words one felt that the basis of the duchesss conversation came directly from guermantes in this way the duchess differed profoundly from her nephew saintloup the prey of so many new ideas and expressions it is difficult when ones mind is troubled by the ideas of kant and the longings of baudelaire to write the exquisite french of henri iv which meant that the very purity of the duchesss language was a sign of limitation and that in her both her intelligence and her sensibility had remained proof against all innovation here again mme de guermantess mind attracted me just because of what it excluded was exactly the content of my own thoughts and by everything which by virtue of that exclusion it had been able to preserve that seductive vigour of the supple bodies which no exhausting necessity to think no moral anxiety or nervous trouble has deformed her mind of a formation so anterior to my own was for me the equivalent of what had been offered me by the procession of the girls of the little band along the seashore mme de guermantes offered me domesticated and held in subjection by her natural courtesy by the respect due to another persons intellectual worth all the energy and charm of a cruel little girl of one of the noble families round combray who from her childhood had been brought up in the saddle tortured cats gouged out the eyes of rabbits and albeit she had remained a pillar of virtue might equally well have been a good few years ago now the most brilliant mistress of the prince de sagan only she was incapable of realising what i had sought for in her the charm of her historic name and the tiny quantity of it that i had found in her a rustic survival from guermantes were our relations founded upon a misunderstanding which could not fail to become manifest as soon as my homage instead of being addressed to the relatively superior woman that she believed herself to be should be diverted to some other woman of equal mediocrity and breathing the same unconscious charm a misunderstanding so entirely natural and one that will always exist between a young dreamer like myself and a woman of the world one however that profoundly disturbs him so long as he has not yet discovered the nature of his imaginative faculties and has not acquired his share of the inevitable disappointments which he is destined to find in people as in the theatre in his travels and indeed in love m de guermantes having declared following upon elstirs asparagus and those that were brought round after the financiere chicken that green asparagus grown in the open air which as has been so quaintly said by the charming writer who signs himself e de clermonttonnerre have not the impressive rigidity of their sisters ought to be eaten with eggs one mans meat is another mans poison as they say replied m de bréauté in the province of canton in china the greatest delicacy that can be set before one is a dish of ortolans eggs completely rotten m de bréauté the author of an essay on the mormons which had appeared in the revue des deux mondes moved in none but the most aristocratic circles but among these visited only such as had a certain reputation for intellect with the result that from his presence were it at all regular in a womans house one could tell that she had a salon he pretended to a loathing of society and assured each of his duchesses in turn that it was for the sake of her wit and beauty that he came to see her they all believed him whenever with death in his heart he resigned himself to attending a big party at the princesse de parmes he summoned them all to accompany him to keep up his courage and thus appeared only to be moving in the midst of an intimate group so that his reputation as an intellectual might survive his worldly success applying certain maxims of the guermantes spirit he would set out with ladies of fashion on long scientific expeditions at the height of the dancing season and when a woman who was a snob and consequently still without any definite position began to go everywhere he would put a savage obstinacy into his refusal to know her to allow himself to be introduced to her his hatred of snobs was a derivative of his snobbishness but made the simpletons in other words everyone believe that he was immune from snobbishness babal always knows everything exclaimed the duchesse de guermantes i think it must be charming a country where you can be quite sure that your dairyman will supply you with really rotten eggs eggs of the year of the comet i can see myself dipping my bread and butter in them i must say you get the same thing at aunt madeleines mme de villeparisiss where everythings served in a state of putrefaction eggs included then as mme darpajon protested but my dear phili you know it as well as i do you can see the chicken in the egg what i cannot understand is how they manage not to fall out it is not an omelette you get there it is a poultryyard you were so wise not to come to dinner there yesterday there was a brill cooked in carbolic i assure you it was not a dinnertable it was far more like an operatingtable really norpois carries loyalty to the pitch of heroism he actually asked for more i believe i saw you at dinner there the time she made that attack on m bloch m de guermantes perhaps to give to an israelite name a more foreign sound pronounced the ch in bloch not like a k but as in the german hoch when he said about some poit poet or other that he was sublime châtellerault did his best to break m blochs shins the fellow did not understand in the least and thought my nephews kick was aimed at a young woman sitting opposite him at this point m de guermantes coloured slightly he did not realise that he was annoying our aunt by his sublimes chucked about all over the place like that in short aunt madeleine who does not keep her tongue in her pocket turned on him with indeed sir and what epithet do you keep for m de bousset m de guermantes thought that when one mentioned a famous name the use of monsieur and a particle was eminently old school that put him in his place all right and what answer did this m bloch make came in a careless tone from mme de guermantes who running short for the moment of original ideas felt that she must copy her husbands teutonic pronunciation ah i can assure you m bloch did not wait for any more he is still running yes i remember quite well seeing you there that evening said mme de guermantes with emphasis as though coming from her there must be something in this reminiscence highly flattering to myself it is always so interesting at my aunts at the last party she gave which was of course when i met you i meant to ask you whether that old gentleman who went past where we were sitting was not françois coppée you must know who everyone is she went on sincerely envious of my relations with poets and poetry and also out of consideration for myself the wish to establish in a better position in the eyes of her other guests a young man so well d in literature i assured the duchess that i had not observed any celebrities at mme de villeparisiss party what she replied with a bewilderment which revealed that her respect for men of letters and her contempt for society were more superficial than she said perhaps even than she thought what there were no famous authors there you astonish me why i saw all sorts of quite impossible people i remembered the evening in question distinctly owing to an entirely trivial incident that had occurred at the party mme de villeparisis had introduced bloch to mme alphonse de rothschild but my friend had not caught the name and thinking he was talking to an old english lady who was a trifle mad had replied only in monosyllables to the garrulous conversation of the historic beauty when mme de villeparisis in making her known to some one else uttered quite distinctly this time the baronne alphonse de rothschild thereupon there had coursed suddenly and simultaneously through blochs arteries so many ideas of millions and of social importance which it would have been more prudent to subdivide and separate that he had undergone so to speak a momentary failure of heart and brain alike and cried aloud in the dear old ladys presence if i would only known an exclamation the silliness of which kept him from sleeping for at least a week afterwards his remark was of no great interest but i remembered it as a proof that sometimes in this life under the stress of an exceptional emotion people do say what is in their minds i fancy mme de villeparisis is not absolutely moral said the princesse de parme who knew that the best people did not visit the duchesss aunt and from what the duchess herself had just been saying that one might speak freely about her but mme de guermantes not seeming to approve of this criticism she hastened to add though of course intellect carried to that degree excuses everything but you take the same view of my aunt that everyone else does replied the duchess which is really quite mistaken it is just what mémé was saying to me only yesterday she blushed a reminiscence unknown to me filmed her eyes i formed the supposition that m de charlus had asked her to cancel my invitation as he had sent robert to ask me not to go to her house i had the impression that the blush equally incomprehensible to me which had tinged the dukes cheek when he made some reference to his brother could not be attributed to the same because my poor aunt she will always have the reputation of being a lady of the old school of sparkling wit and uncontrolled passions and really there is no more middleclass serious commonplace mind in paris she will go down as a patron of the arts which means to say that she was once the mistress of a great painter though he was never able to make her understand what a picture was and as for her private life so far from being a depraved woman she was so much made for marriage so conjugal from her cradle that not having succeeded in keeping a husband who incidentally was a cad she has never had a loveaffair which she has not taken just as seriously as if it were holy matrimony with the same susceptibilities the same quarrels the same fidelity by which token those relations are often the most sincere you will find in fact more inconsolable lovers than husbands yet oriane if you take the case of your brotherinlaw palamede you were speaking about just now no mistress in the world could ever dream of being mourned as that poor mme de charlus has been ah replied the duchess your highness must permit me to be not altogether of her opinion people do not all like to be mourned in the same way each of us has his preferences still he did make a regular cult of her after her death it is true that people sometimes do for the dead what they would not have done for the living for one thing retorted mme de guermantes in a dreamy tone which belied her teasing purpose we go to their funerals which we never do for the living m de guermantes gave a sly glance at m de bréauté as though to provoke him into laughter at the duchesss wit at the same time i frankly admit went on mme de guermantes that the manner in which i should like to be mourned by a man i loved would not be that adopted by my brotherinlaw the dukes face darkened he did not like to hear his wife utter rash judgments especially about m de charlus you are very particular his grief set an example to everyone he reproved her stiffly but the duchess had in dealing with her husband that sort of boldness which animal tamers shew or people who live with a madman and are not afraid of making him angry oh very well just as you like he does set an example i never said he did not he goes every day to the cemetery to tell her how many people he has had to luncheon he misses her enormously but as he would mourn for a cousin a grandmother a sister it is not the grief of a husband it is true that they were a pair of saints which makes it all rather exceptional m de guermantes infuriated by his wifes chatter fixed on her with a terrible immobility a pair of eyes already loaded i do not wish to say anything against poor mémé who by the way could not come this evening went on the duchess i quite admit there is no one like him he is delightful he has a delicacy a warmth of heart that you do not as a rule find in men he has a womans heart mémé has what you say is absurd m de guermantes broke in sharply there is nothing effeminate about mémé i know nobody so manly as he is but i am not suggesting that he is the least bit in the world effeminate do at least take the trouble to understand what i say retorted the duchess he is always like that the moment anyone mentions his brother she added turning to the princesse de parme it is very charming it is a pleasure to hear him there is nothing so nice as two brothers who are fond of each other replied the princess as many a humbler person might have replied for it is possible to belong to a princely race by birth and at the same time to be mentally affiliated to a race that is thoroughly plebeian as we are discussing your family oriane said the princess i saw your nephew saintloup yesterday i believe he wants to ask you to do something for him the duc de guermantes bent his olympian brow when he did not himself care to do a service he preferred his wife not to assume the responsibility for it knowing that it would come to the same thing in the end and that the people to whom the duchess would be obliged to apply would put this concession down to the common account of the household just as much as if it had been asked of them by the husband alone why did not he tell me about it himself said the duchess he was here yesterday and stayed a couple of hours and heaven only knows what a bore he managed to make himself he would be no stupider than anyone else if he had only the sense like many people we know to be content with being a fool it is his veneer of knowledge that is so terrible he wants to preserve an open mind open to all the things he does not understand he talks to you about morocco it is appalling he cannot go back there because of rachel said the prince de foix surely now that they have broken it off interrupted m de bréauté so far from breaking it off i found her a couple of days ago in roberts rooms they did not look at all like people who would quarrelled i can assure you replied the prince de foix who loved to spread abroad every rumour that could damage roberts chances of marrying and might for that matter have been misled by one of the intermittent resumptions of a connexion that was practically at an end that rachel was speaking to me about you i see her like that in the mornings on the way to the champselysées she is a kind of headinair as you say what you call unlaced a sort of dame aux camélias only figuratively speaking of course this speech was addressed to me by prince von who liked always to appear conversant with french literature and parisian catchwords why that is just what it was morocco exclaimed the princess flinging herself into this opening what on earth can he want in morocco asked m de guermantes sternly oriane can do absolutely nothing for him there as he knows perfectly well he thinks he invented strategy mme de guermantes pursued the theme and then he uses impossible words for the most trivial things which does not prevent him from making blots all over his letters the other day he announced that he would been given some sublime potatoes and that he would taken a sublime stage box he speaks latin the duke went one better what latin the princesse gasped pon my soul he does madam can ask oriane if i am not telling the truth why of course madam the other day he said to us straight out without stopping to think i know of no more touching example of sic transit gloria mundi i can repeat the phrase now to your highness because after endless inquiries and by appealing to linguists we succeeded in reconstructing it but robert flung it out without pausing for breath one could hardly make out that there was latin in it he was just like a character in the malade imaginaire and all this referred simply to the death of the empress of austria poor woman cried the princess what a delicious creature she was yes replied the duchess a trifle mad a trifle headstrong but she was a thoroughly good woman a nice kindhearted lunatic the only thing i could never make out about her was why she had never managed to get her teeth made to fit her they always came loose halfway through a sentence and she was obliged to stop short or she would have swallowed them that rachel was speaking to me about you she told me that young saintloup worshipped you that he was fonder of you than he was of her said prince von to me devouring his food like an ogre as he spoke his face scarlet his teeth bared by his perpetual grin but in that case she must be jealous of me and hate me said i not at all she told me all sorts of nice things about you the prince de foixs mistress would perhaps be jealous if he preferred you to her you do not understand come home with me and i will explain it all to you i am afraid i cannot i am going on to m de charlus at eleven why he sent round to me yesterday to ask me to dine with him this evening but told me not to come after a quarter to eleven but if you must go to him at least come with me as far as the théâtre français you will be in the periphery said the prince who thought doubtless that this last word meant proximity or possibly centre but the bulging eyes in his coarse though handsome red face frightened me and i declined saying that a friend was coming to call for me this reply seemed to me in no way offensive the prince however apparently formed a different impression of it for he did not say another word to me i really must go and see the queen of naples what a grief it must be to her said or at least appeared to me to have said the princesse de parme for her words had come to me only indistinctly through the intervening screen of those addressed to me albeit in an undertone by prince von who had doubtless been afraid if he spoke louder of being overheard by the prince de foix oh dear no replied the duchess i do not believe it has been any grief at all none at all you do always fly to extremes so oriane said m de guermantes resuming his part of the cliff which by standing up to the wave forces it to fling higher its crest of foam basin knows even better than i that i am telling the truth replied the duchess but he thinks he is obliged to look severe because you are present madam and he is afraid of my shocking you oh please no i beg of you cried the princesse de parme dreading the slightest alteration on her account of these delicious fridays at the duchesse de guermantess this forbidden fruit which the queen of sweden herself had not yet acquired the right to taste why it was basin himself that she told when he said to her with a duly sorrowful expression but the queen is in mourning for whom pray is it a great grief to your majestyno it is not a deep mourning it is a light mourning quite a light mourning it is my sister the truth is she is delighted about it as basin knows perfectly well she invited us to a party that very evening and gave me two pearls i wish she could lose a sister every day so far from weeping for her sisters death she was in fits of laughter over it she probably says to herself like robert sic transit i forget how it goes on she added modestly knowing how it went on perfectly well in saying all this mme de guermantes was only being witty and with complete insincerity for the queen of naples like the duchesse dalençon also doomed to a tragic fate had the warmest heart in the world and mourned quite sincerely for her kinsfolk mme de guermantes knew those noble bavarian sisters her cousins too well not to be aware of this he would like not to go back to morocco said the princesse de parme alighting hurriedly again upon the perch of roberts name which had been held out to her quite unintentionally by mme de guermantes i believe you know general de monserfeuil very slightly replied the duchess who was an intimate friend of the officer in question the princess explained what it was that saintloup wanted good gracious yes if i see him it is possible that i may meet him the duchess replied so as not to appear to be refusing the occasions of her meeting general de monserfeuil seeming to extend rapidly farther apart as soon as it became a question of her asking him for anything this uncertainty did not however satisfy the duke who interrupted his wife you know perfectly well you will not seeing him oriane and besides you have already asked him for two thing which he has not done my wife has a passion for doing good turns to people he went on growing more and more furious in order to force the princess to withdraw her request without there being any question made of his wifes good nature and so that mme de parme should throw the blame back upon his own character which was essentially obstructive robert could get anything he wanted out of monserfeuil only as he happens not to know himself what he wants he gets us to ask for it because he knows there is no better way of making the whole thing fall through oriane has asked too many favours of monserfeuil a request from her now would be a reason for him to refuse oh in that case it would be better if the duchess did nothing said mme de parme obviously the duke closed the discussion poor general he is been defeated again at the elections said the princess so as to turn the conversation from robert oh it is nothing serious it is only the seventh time said the duke who having been obliged himself to retire from politics quite enjoyed hearing of other peoples failures at the polls he has consoled himself by giving his wife another baby what is that poor mme de monserfeuil in an interesting condition again cried the princess why of course replied the duke that is the one division where the poor general has never failed to get in in the period that followed i was continually to be invited were it with a small party only to these repasts at which i had at one time imagined the guests as seated like the apostles in the saintechapelle they did assemble there indeed like the early christians not to partake merely of a material nourishment which incidentally was exquisite but in a sort of social eucharist so that in the course of a few dinnerparties i assimilated the acquaintance of all the friends of my hosts friends to whom they presented me with a shade of benevolent patronage so marked as a person for whom they had always had a sort of parental affection that there was not one among them who would not have felt himself to be failing in his duty to the duke and duchess if he had given a ball without including my name on his list and at the same time while i sipped one of those yquems which lay concealed in the guermantes cellars i tasted ortolans dressed according to each of the different recipes which the duke himself used to elaborate and modified with prudence however for one who had already set his knees more than once beneath the mystic board the consumption of the latter was not indispensable old friends of m and mme de guermantes came in to see them after dinner with the toothpicks as mme swann would have said without being expected and took in winter a cup of tilleul in the lighted warmth of the great drawingroom in summer a glass of orangeade in the darkness of the little rectangular strip of garden outside there was no record of anything else among the guermantes in these evenings in the garden but orangeade it had a sort of ritual meaning to have added other refreshments would have seemed to be falsifying the tradition just as a big athome in the faubourg saintgermain ceases to be an athome if there is a play also or music you must be supposed to have come simply though there be five hundred of you to pay a call on let us say the princesse de guermantes people marvelled at my influence because i was able to procure the addition to this orangeade of a jug containing the juice of stewed cherries or stewed pears i took a dislike on this account to the prince dagrigente who was like all the people who lacking in imagination but not in covetousness take a keen interest in what one is drinking and ask if they may taste a little of it themselves which meant that every time m dagrigente by diminishing my ration spoiled my pleasure for this fruit juice can never be provided in sufficient quantities to quench ones thirst for it nothing is less cloying than these transpositions into flavour of the colour of a fruit which when cooked seems to have travelled backwards to the past season of its blossoming blushing like an orchard in spring or it may be colourless and cool like the zephyr beneath the fruittrees the juice let us itself be breathed and gazed into one drop by drop and m dagrigente prevented me regularly from taking my fill of it despite these distillations the traditional orangeade persisted like the tilleul in these humble kinds the social communion was none the less administered in this respect doubtless the friends of m and mme de guermantes had after all as i had originally imagined remained more different from the rest of humanity than their outward appearance might have misled me into supposing numbers of elderly men came to receive from the duchess together with the invariable drink a welcome that was often far from cordial now this could not have been due to snobbishness they themselves being of a rank to which there was none superior nor to love of splendour they did love it perhaps but on less stringent social conditions might have been enjoying a glittering example of it for on these same evenings the charming wife of a colossally rich financier would have given anything in the world to have them among the brilliant shootingparty she was giving for a couple of days for the king of spain they had nevertheless declined her invitation and had come round without fail to inquire whether mme de guermantes was at home they were not even certain of finding there opinions that conformed entirely with their own or sentiments of any great warmth mme de guermantes let fall now and then on the dreyfus case on the republic the laws against religion or even in an undertone on themselves their weaknesses the dullness of their conversation comments which they had to appear not to notice no doubt if they kept up their habit of coming there it was owing to their superfine training as epicures in things worldly to their clear consciousness of the prime and perfect quality of the social dish with its familiar reassuring sappy savour free from blend or taint with the origin and history of which they were as well aware as she who served them with it remaining more noble in this respect than they themselves imagined now on this occasion among the visitors to whom i was introduced after dinner it so happened that there was that general de monserfeuil of whom the princesse de parme had been speaking while mme de guermantes of whose drawingroom he was one of the regular frequenters had not known that he was going to be there that evening he bowed before me on hearing my name as though i had been the president of the supreme war council i had supposed it to be simply from some deeprooted unwillingness to oblige in which the duke as in wit if not in love was his wifes accomplice that the duchess had practically refused to recommend her nephew to m de monserfeuil and i saw in this an indifference all the more blameworthy in that i seemed to have gathered from a few words let fall by the princess that robert was in a post of danger from which it would be prudent to have him removed but it was by the genuine malice of mme de guermantes that i was revolted when the princesse de parme having timidly suggested that she might say something herself and on her own responsibility to the general the duchess did everything in her power to dissuade her but madam she cried monserfeuil has no sort of standing or influence whatever with the new government you would be wasting your breath i think he can hear us murmured the princess as a hint to the duchess not to speak so loud without lowering her voice your highness need not be afraid he is as deaf as a post said the duchess every word reaching the general distinctly the thing is i believe m de saintloup is in a place that is not very safe said the princess what is one to do replied the duchess he is in the same boat as everybody else the only difference being that it was he who originally asked to be sent there besides no it is not really dangerous if it was you can imagine how anxious i should be to help i should have spoken to saintjoseph about it during dinner he has far more influence and he is a real worker but as you see he is gone now still asking him would be less awkward than going to this one who has three of his sons in morocco just now and has refused to apply for them to be exchanged he might raise that as an objection since your highness insists on it i shall speak to saintjoseph if i see him again or to beautreillis but if i do not see either of them you must not waste your pity on robert it was explained to us the other day exactly where he is i am sure he could not wish for a better place what a pretty flower i have never seen one like it there is no one like you oriane for having such marvellous things in your house said the princesse de parme who fearing that general de monserfeuil might have overheard the duchess sought now to change the conversation i looked and recognised a plant of the sort that i had watched elstir painting i am so glad you like them they are charming do look at their little purple velvet collars the only thing against them is as may happen with people who are very pretty and very nicely dressed they have a hideous name and a horrid smell in spite of which i am very fond of them but what is rather sad is that they are dying but they are growing in a pot they are not cut flowers said the princess no answered the duchess with a smile but it comes to the same thing as they are all ladies it is a kind of plant where the ladies and the gentlemen do not both grow on the same stalk i am like people who keep a lady dog i have to find a husband for my flowers otherwise i shall not have any young ones how very strange do you mean to say that in nature yes there are certain insects whose duty it is to bring about the marriage as they do with sovereigns by proxy without the bride and bridegroom ever having set eyes on one another and so i assure you i always tell my man to put my plant out in the window as often as possible on the courtyard side and the garden side turn about in the hope that the necessary insect will arrive but the odds are too great fancy he has first to have been seen by a person of the same species and the opposite sex and he must then have taken it into his head to come and leave cards at the house he has not appeared so far i believe my plant can still qualify for the white flower of a blameless life but i must say a little immodesty would please me better it is just the same with that fine tree we have in the courtyard he will die childless because he belongs to a kind that is very rare in these latitudes in his case it is the wind that is responsible for consummating the marriage but the wall is a trifle high by jove yes said m de bréauté you ought to take just a couple of inches off the top that will be quite enough there are certain operations one ought to know how to perform the flavour of vanilla we tasted in the excellent ice you gave us this evening duchess comes from a plant called the vanilla tree this plant produces flowers which are both male and female but a sort of solid wall set up between them prevents any communication and so we could never get any fruit from them until a young negro a native of réunion by the name of albins which by the way is rather an odd name for a black man since it means white had the happy thought of using the point of a needle to bring the separate organs into contact babal you are divine you know everything cried the duchess but you yourself oriane have told me things i had no idea of the princesse de parme assured her i must explain to your highness that it is swann who has always talked to me all about botany sometimes when we were too bored to go to a teaparty or a concert we would set off for the country and he would shew me extraordinary marriages between flowers which was far more amusing than going to human marriages no weddingbreakfast and no crowd in the sacristy we never had time to go very far now that motorcars have come in it would be delightful unfortunately in the interval he himself has made an even more astonishing marriage which makes everything very difficult oh madam life is a dreadful business we spend our whole time doing things that bore us and when by mere chance we come across somebody with whom we could go and look at something really interesting he has to make a marriage like swanns faced with the alternatives of giving up my botanical expeditions and being obliged to call upon a degrading person i chose the former calamity besides when it comes to that there was no need to go quite so far it seems that here in my own little bit of garden more odd things happen in broad daylight than at midnight in the bois de boulogne only they attract no attention because among flowers it is all done quite simply you see a little orange shower or else a very dusty fly coming to wipe its feet or take a bath before crawling into a flower and that does the trick the cabinet the plant is standing on is splendid too it is empire i think said the princess who not being familiar with the works of darwin and his followers was unable to grasp the point of the duchesss pleasantries it is lovely is not it i am so glad madam likes it replied the duchess it is a magnificent piece i must tell you that i have always adored the empire style even when it was not in fashion i remember at guermantes i got into terrible disgrace with my motherinlaw because i told them to bring down from the attics all the splendid empire furniture basin had inherited from the montesquious and used it to furnish the wing we lived in m de guermantes smiled he must nevertheless have remembered that the course of events had been totally different but the witticisms of the princesse des laumes at the expense of her motherinlaws bad taste having been a tradition during the short time in which the prince was in love with his wife his love for the latter had been outlasted by a certain contempt for the intellectual inferiority of the former a contempt which however went hand in hand with a considerable attachment and respect the iénas have the same armchair with wedgwood medallions it is a lovely thing but i prefer my own said the duchess with the same air of impartiality as if she had been the possessor of neither of the articles under discussion i know of course that they have some marvellous things which i have not got the princesse de parme remained silent but it is quite true your highness has not seen their collection oh you ought really to come there one day with me it is one of the most magnificent things in paris you would say it was a museum come to life and since this suggestion was one of the most guermantes of the duchesss audacities inasmuch as the lénas were for the princesse de parme rank usurpers their son bearing like her own the title of duc de guastalla mme de guermantes in thus launching it could not refrain so far did the love that she bore for her own originality prevail over the deference due to the princesse de parme from casting at her other guests a smiling glance of amusement they too made an effort to smile at once frightened bewildered and above all delighted to think that they were being earwitnesses of orianes very latest and could carry it away with them red hot they were only half shocked knowing that the duchess had the knack of strewing the ground with all the courvoisier prejudices to achieve a vital success more thrilling and more enjoyable had she not within the last few years brought together princesse mathilde and that due daumale who had written to the princesss own brother the famous letter in my family all the men are brave and the women chaste and inasmuch as princes remain princely even at those moments when they appear anxious to forget that they are the due daumale and princesse mathilde had enjoyed themselves so greatly at mme de guermantess that they had thereafter formed a defensive alliance with that faculty for forgetting the past which louis xviii shewed when he took as his minister fouché who had voted the death of his brother mme de guermantes was now nourishing a similar project of arranging a meeting between princesse murât and the queen of naples in the meantime the princesse de parme appeared as embarrassed as might have been the heirsapparent to the thrones of the netherlands and belgium styled respectively prince of orange and duke of brabant had one offered to present to them m de mailly nesle prince dorange and m de charlus due de brabant but before anything further could happen the duchess whom swann and m de charlus between them albeit the latter was resolute in ignoring the lénas existence had with great difficulty succeeded in making admire the empire style exclaimed honestly madam i cannot tell you how beautiful you will think it i must confess that the empire style has always had a fascination for me but at the lénas it is really like a hallucination that sort of what shall i say reflux from the expedition to egypt and also the sweep forward into our own times from antiquity all those things that invade our houses the sphinxes that come to crouch at the feet of the sofas the serpents coiled round candelabra a huge muse who holds out a little torch for you to play at bouillotte or has quietly climbed on to the mantelpiece and is leaning against your clock and then all the pompeian lamps the little boatshaped beds which look as if they had been found floating on the nile so that you expect to see moses climb out of them the classical chariots galloping along the bed tables they are not very comfortable to sit in those empire chairs the princess ventured no the duchess agreed but she at once added insisting on the point with a smile i like being uncomfortable on those mahogany seats covered with ruby velvet or green silk i like that discomfort of the warrior who understands nothing but the curule chair and in the middle of his principal drawingroom crosses his fasces and piles his laurels i can assure you that at the iénas one does not stop to think for a moment of how comfortable one is when one sees in front of one a great strapping wench of a victory painted in fresco on the wall my husband is going to say that i am a very bad royalist but i am terribly disaffected as you know i can assure you that in those peoples house one comes to love all the big ns and all the bees good gracious after all for a good many years under our kings we were not exactly surfeited with glory and so these warriors who brought home so many crowns that they stuck them even on the arms of the chairs i must say i think it is all rather fetching your highness ought really why my dear if you think so said the princess but it seems to me that it will not be easy but madam will find that it will all go quite smoothly they are very good people and no fools we took mme de chevreuse there added the duchess knowing the force of this example she was enchanted the son is really very pleasant i am going to say something that is not quite proper she went on but he has a bedroom and more especially a bed in it in which i should love to sleep without him what is even less proper is that i went to see him once when he was ill and lying in it by his side on the frame of the bed was moulded a long siren stretched out at full length a lovely thing with a motherofpearl tail and some sort of lotus flowers in her hand i assure you went on mme de guermantes reducing the speed of her utterances to bring into even bolder relief the words which she had the air of modelling with the pout of her fine lips drawing them out with her long expressive hands directing on the princess as she spoke a gentle steady and searching gaze that with the palms and the golden crown at the side it was most moving it was just the arrangement of gustave moreaus death and the young man your highness must know that great work of course the princesse de parme who did not know so much as the painters name made violent movements with her head and smiled ardently in order to manifest her admiration for his picture but the intensity of her mimicry could not fill the place of that light which is absent from our eyes so long as we do not understand what people are trying to tell us a goodlooking boy i believe she asked no for he is just like a tapir the eyes are a little those of a queen hortense on a screen but he has probably come to the conclusion that it is rather absurd for a man to develop such a resemblance and it is lost in the encaustic surface of his cheeks which give him really rather a mameluke appearance you feel that the polisher must call round every morning swann she went on reverting to the bed of the young duke was struck by the resemblance between this siren and gustave moreaus death but apart from that she added her speech becoming more rapid though still serious so as to provoke more laughter there was nothing really that could strike us for it was only a cold in the head and the young man made a marvellous recovery they say he is a snob put in m de bréauté with a malicious twinkle expecting to be answered with the same precision as though he had said they tell me that he has only four fingers on his right hand is that so g ood g racious n o replied mme de guermantes with a smile of benign indulgence perhaps just the least little bit of a snob in appearance because he is extremely young but i should be surprised to hear that he was really for he is intelligent she added as though there were to her mind some absolute incompatibility between snobbishness and intelligence he has wit too i have known him to be quite amusing she said again laughing with the air of an epicure and expert as though the act of declaring that a person could be amusing demanded a certain expression of merriment from the speaker or as though the duc de guastallas sallies were recurring to her mind as she spoke anyway as he never goes anywhere he cannot have much field for his snobbishness she wound up forgetting that this was hardly encouraging the princesse de parme to make overtures i cannot help wondering what the prince de guermantes who calls her mme iéna will say if he hears that i have been to see her what cried the duchess with extraordinary vivacity do not you know that it was we who gave up to gilbert she bitterly regretted that surrender now a complete cardroom done in the empire style which came to us from quiouquiou and is an absolute marvel there was no room for it here though i think it would look better here than it does with him it is a thing of sheer beauty half etruscan half egyptian egyptian queried the princess to whom the word etruscan conveyed little well really you know a little of both swann told us that he explained it all to me only you know i am such a dunce but then madam what one has to bear in mind is that the egypt of the empire cabinetmakers has nothing to do with the historical egypt nor their roman with the romans nor their etruria indeed said the princess no it is like what they used to call a louis xv costume under the second empire when anna de monchy and dear brigodes mother were girls basin was talking to you just now about beethoven we heard a thing of his played the other day which was really quite good though a little stiff with a russian theme in it it is pathetic to think that he believed it to be russian in the same way as the chinese painters believed they were copying bellini besides even in the same country whenever anybody begins to look at things in a way that is slightly novel nine hundred and ninetynine people out of a thousand are totally incapable of seeing what he puts before them it takes at least forty years before they can manage to make it out forty years the princess cried in alarm why yes went on the duchess adding more and more to her words which were practically my own for i had just been expressing a similar idea to her thanks to her way of pronouncing them the equivalent of what on the printed page is called italics it is like a sort of first isolated individual of a species which does not yet exist but is going to multiply in the future an individual endowed with a kind of sense which the human race of his generation does not possess i can hardly give myself as an instance because i on the contrary have always loved any interesting production from the very start however novel it might be but really the other day i was with the grand duchess in the louvre and we happened to pass before manets olympia nowadays nobody is in the least surprised by it it looks just like an ingres and yet heaven only knows how many spears i have had to break for that picture which i do not altogether like but which is unquestionably the work of somebody and is the grand duchess well inquired the princesse de parme to whom the tsars aunt was infinitely more familiar than manets model yes we talked about you after all she resumed clinging to her idea the fact of the matter is as my brotherinlaw palamede always says that one has between oneself and the rest of the world the barrier of a strange language though i admit that there is no one it is quite so true of as gilbert if it amuses you to go to the iénas you have far too much sense to let your actions be governed by what that poor fellow may think who is a dear innocent creature but really lives in a different world i feel myself nearer more akin to my coachman my horses even than to a man who keeps on harking back to what people would have thought under philip the bold or louis the fat just fancy when he goes for a walk in the country he takes a stick to drive the peasants out of his way quite in a friendly spirit saying get on clowns really i am just as much surprised when he speaks to me as if i heard myself addressed by one of the recumbents on the old gothic tombs it is all very well that animated gravestones being my cousin he frightens me and the only idea that comes into my head is to let him stay in his middle ages apart from that i quite admit that he is never assassinated anyone i have just been seeing him at dinner at mme de villeparisiss said the general but without either smiling at or endorsing the duchesss pleasantries was m de norpois there asked prince von whose mind still ran on the academy of moral sciences why yes said the general in fact he was talking about your emperor it seems the emperor william is highly intelligent but he does not care for elstirs painting not that i am saying this against him said the duchess i quite share his point of view although elstir has done a fine portrait of me you do not know it it is not in the least like me but it is a remarkable piece of work he is interesting while ones sitting to him he has made me like a little old woman it is after the style of the regents of the hospital by hals i expect you know those sublimities to borrow my nephews favourite expression the duchess turned to myself gently flapping her fan of black feathers more than erect on her chair she flung her head nobly backwards for while always a great lady she was a trifle inclined to play the great lady also i said that i had been once to amsterdam and the hague but that to avoid confusing my mind as my time was limited i had left out haarlem ah the hague what a gallery cried m de guermantes i said to him that he had doubtless admired vermeers street in delft but the duke was less erudite than arrogant accordingly he contented himself with replying in a tone of sufficiency as was his habit whenever anyone spoke to him of a picture in a gallery or in the salon which he did not remember having seen if it is to be seen i saw it what you have been to holland and you never visited haarlem cried the duchess why even if you had only a quarter of an hour to spend in the place they are an extraordinary thing to have seen those halses i do not mind saying that a person who only caught a passing glimpse of them from the top of a tramwaycar without stopping supposing they were hung out to view in the street would open his eyes pretty wide this utterance shocked me as indicating a misconception of the way in which artistic impressions are formed in our minds and because it seemed to imply that our eye is in that case simply a recording machine which takes instantaneous photographs m de guermantes rejoicing that she should be speaking to me with so competent a knowledge of the subjects that interested me gazed at the illustrious bearing of his wife listened to what she was saying about franz hals and thought she rides roughshod over everything our young friend can go home and say that he is had before his eyes a great lady of the old school in the full sense of the word the like of whom could not be found anywhere today thus i beheld the pair of them withdrawn from that name guermantes in which long ago i had imagined them leading an unimaginable life now just like other men and other women lingering only behind their contemporaries a little way and that not evenly as in so many households of the faubourg where the wife has had the good taste to stop at the golden the husband the misfortune to come down to the pinchbeck age of history she remaining still louis xv while her partner is pompously louisphilippe that mme de guermantes should be like other women had been for me at first a disappointment it was now by a natural reaction and with all these good wines to help almost a miracle a don john of austria an isabella desté situated for us in the world of names have as little communication with the great pages of history as the méséglise way had with the guermantes isabella desté was no doubt in reality a very minor princess similar to those who under louis xiv obtained no special place at court but seeming to us to be of a unique and therefore incomparable essence we cannot conceive of her as being any less in greatness so that a supperparty with louis xiv would appear to us only to be rather interesting whereas with isabella deste we should find ourselves were we to meet her gazing with our own eyes on a supernatural heroine of romance well after we have in studying isabella desté in transplanting her patiently from this world of fairyland into that of history established the fact that her life her thought contained nothing of that mysterious strangeness which had been suggested to us by her name once this disappointment is complete we feel a boundless gratitude to this princess for having had of mantegnas paintings a knowledge almost equal to that hitherto despised by us and put as françoise would have said lower than the dirt of m lafenestre after having scaled the inaccessible heights of the name guermantes on descending the inner slope of the life of the duchess i felt on finding there the names familiar elsewhere of victor hugo franz hals and i regret to say vibert the same astonishment that an explorer after having taken into account to imagine the singularity of the native customs in some wild valley of central america or northern africa its geographical remoteness the strangeness of its flora feels on discovering once he has made his way through a hedge of giant aloes or manchineels inhabitants who sometimes indeed among the ruins of a roman theatre and beneath a column dedicated to venus are engaged in reading mérope or alzire and similarly so remote so distinct from so far superior to the educated women of the middle classes whom i had known the similar culture by which mme de guermantes had made herself with no ulterior motive to gratify no ambition descend to the level of people whom she would never know had the character meritorious almost touching by virtue of being wholly useless of an erudition in phoenician antiquities in a politician or a doctor i might have shewn you a very fine one said mme de guermantes still speaking of hals the finest in existence some people say which was left to me by a german cousin unfortunately it turned out to be enfeoffed in the castle you do not know the expression nor i either she added with her fondness for making jokes which made her she thought seem modern at the expense of the old customs to which nevertheless she was unconsciously but keenly attached i am glad you have seen my elstirs but i must admit i should have been a great deal more glad if i could have done you the honours of my hals this enfeoffed picture i know the one said prince von it is the grand duke of hesses hals quite so his brother married my sister said m de guermantes and his mother and orianes were first cousins as well but so far as m elstir is concerned the prince went on i shall take the liberty of saying without having any opinion of his work which i do not know that the hatred with which the emperor pursues him ought not it seems to me to be counted against him the emperor is a man of marvellous intelligence yes i have met him at dinner twice once at my aunt sagans and once at my aunt radziwills and i must say i found him quite unusual i did not find him at all simple but there is something amusing about him something forced she detached the word like a green carnation that is to say a thing that surprises me and docs not please me enormously a thing it is surprising that anyone should have been able to create but which i feel would have been just as well uncreated i trust i am not shocking you the emperor is a man of astounding intelligence resumed the prince he is passionately fond of the arts he has for works of art a taste that is practically infallible if a thing is good he spots it at once and takes a dislike to it if he detests anything there can be no more doubt about it the thing is excellenteveryone smiled you set my mind at rest said the duchess i should be inclined to compare the emperor went on the prince who not knowing how to pronounce the word archaeologist that is to say as though it were spelt arkeologist never missed an opportunity of using it to an old archaeologist but the prince said arsheologist we have in berlin if you put him in front of a genuine assyrian antique he weeps but if it is a modern sham if it is not really old he does not weep and so when they want to know whether an arsheological piece is really old they take it to the old arsheologist if he weeps they buy the piece for the museum if his eyes remain dry they send it back to the dealer and prosecute him for fraud well every time i dine at potsdam if the emperor says to me of a play prince you must see that it is a work of genius i make a note not to go to it and when i hear him fulminating against an exhibition i rush to see it at the first possible opportunity norpois is in favour of an anglofrench understanding is not he said m de guermantes what use would that be to you asked prince von who could not endure the english in a tone at once of irritation and cunning the english are so schtubid i know of course that it would not be as soldiers that they would help you but one can judge them all the same by the stupidity of their generals a friend of mine was talking the other day to botha you know the boer leader he said to my friend it is terrible an army like that i rather like the english as a matter of fact but just imagine that i who am only a peasant have beaten them in every battle and in the last when i gave way before a force twenty times the strength of my own while i myself surrendered because i had to i managed to take two thousand prisoners that was good enough because i was only commanding an army of farmers but if those poor fools ever have to stand up against a european army one trembles to think what may happen to them besides you have only to see how their king whom you know as well as i do passes for a great man in england i barely listened to these stories stories of the kind that m de norpois used to tell my father they supplied no food for my favourite train of thought and besides even had they possessed the elements which they lacked they would have had to be of a very exciting quality for my inner life to awaken during those hours in which i dwelt in my skin my wellbrushed hair my starched shirtfront in which that is to say i could feel nothing of what constituted for me the pleasure of life oh i do not agree with you at all said mme de guermantes who felt that the german prince was wanting in tact i find king edward charming so simple and much cleverer than people think and the queen is even now the most beautiful thing i have ever seen in the world but madame la duchesse said the prince who was losing his temper and did not see that he was giving offence you must admit that if the prince of wales had been an ordinary person there is not a club that would not have blackballed him and nobody would have been willing to shake hands with him the queen is charming exceedingly sweet and limited but after all there is something shocking about a royal couple who are literally kept by their subjects who get the big jewish financiers to foot all the bills they ought to pay themselves and create them baronets in return it is like the prince of bulgaria he is our cousin put in the duchess he is a clever fellow he is mine too but we do not think him a good fellow on that account no it is us you ought to make friends with it is the emperors dearest wish but he insists on its coming from the heart he says what i want to see is a hand clasped in mine not waving a hat in the air with that you would be invincible it would be more practical than the anglofrench friendship m de norpois preaches you know him of course the duchess said turning to me so as not to leave me out of the conversation remembering that m de norpois had said that i had once looked as though i wanted to kiss his hand thinking that he had no doubt repeated this story to mme de guermantes and in any event could have spoken of me to her only with malice since in spite of his friendship with my father he had not hesitated to make me appear so ridiculous i did not do what a man of the world would have done he would have said that he detested m de norpois and had let him see it he would have said this so as to give himself the appearance of being the deliberate because of the ambassadors slanders which would then have been no more than lying and calculated reprisals i said on the other hand that to my great regret i was afraid that m de norpois did not like me you are quite mistaken replied the duchess he likes you very much indeed you can ask basin for if people give me the reputation of only saying nice things he certainly does not he will tell you that we have never heard norpois speak about anyone so kindly as he spoke to us of you and only the other day he was wanting to give you a fine post at the ministry as he knew that you were not very strong and could not accept it he had the delicacy not to speak of his kind thought to your father for whom he has an unbounded admiration m de norpois was quite the last person whom i should have expected to do me any practical service the truth was that his being a mocking and indeed somewhat malicious spirit those people who had let themselves be taken in as i had by his outward appearance of a saint louis delivering justice beneath an oaktree by the sounds easily modulated to pity that emerged from his somewhat too tuneful lips believed in a deliberate betrayal when they learned of a slander uttered at their expense by a man who had always seemed to put his whole heart into his speech these slanders were frequent enough with him but that did not prevent him from feeling attractions from praising the people he liked and taking pleasure in shewing that he could be of use to them not that i am in the least surprised at his appreciating you said mme de guermantes he is an intelligent man and i can quite understand she added for the benefit of the rest of the party making allusion to a purpose of marriage of which i had heard nothing that my aunt who has long ceased to amuse him as an old mistress may not seem of very much use to him as a young wife especially as i understand that even as a mistress she has ceased for years now to serve any practical purpose she is more wrapped up in her devotions than anv thing else boaznorpois can say in the words of victor hugo voila longtemps que celle avec qui jai dormi o seigneur a quitté ma couche pour la vôtre really my poor aunt is like the artists of the advanced guard who have stood out all their lives against the academy and in the end start a little academy of their own or the unfrocked priests who get up a little private religion they should either keep their frocks or not stick to their profession and who knows went on the duchess with a meditative air it may be in preparation for her widowhood there is nothing sadder than the weeds ones not entitled to wear ah if mme de villeparisis were to become mme de norpois i really believe our cousin gilbert would take to his bed said general de monserfeuil the prince de guermantes is a charming man but he is really very much taken up with questions of birth and manners said the princesse de parme i went down to spend a few days with them in the country when the princess unfortunately was ill in bed i was accompanied by petite this was a nickname that was given to mme dhunolstein because she was enormously stout the prince came to meet me at the foot of the steps and pretended not to see petite we went up to the first floor to the door into the reception rooms and then stepping back to make way for me he said oh how dye do mme dhunolstein he always calls her that now since her separation pretending to have caught sight of petite for the first time so as to shew her that he had not come down to receive her at the foot of the steps that does not surprise me in the least i do not need to tell you said the duke who regarded himself as extremely modern more contemptuous than anyone in the world of mere birth and in fact a republican that i have not many ideas in common with my cousin madam can imagine that we are just about as much agreed on most subjects as day and night but i must say that if my aunt were to marry norpois for once i should be of gilberts opinion to be the daughter of florimond de guise and then to make a marriage like that would be enough as the saying is to make a cat laugh what more can i say these last words which the duke uttered as a rule in the middle of a sentence were here quite superfluous but he felt a perpetual need to be saying them which made him postpone them to the end of a speech if he had found no place for them elsewhere they were for him among other things almost a question of prosody remember though he added that the norpois are gallant gentlemen with a good place of a good stock listen to me basin it is really not worth your while to poke fun at gilbert if you are going to speak the same language as he does said mme de guermantes for whom the goodness of a family no less than that of a wine consisted in its age but less frank than her cousin and more subtle than her husband she made a point of never in her conversation playing false to the guermantes spirit and despised rank in her speech while ready to honour it by her actions but are not you some sort of cousins asked general de monserfeuil i seem to remember that norpois married a la rochefoucauld not in that way at all she belonged to the branch of the ducs de la rochefoucauld my grandmother came from the ducs de doudeauville she was own grandmother to edouard coco the wisest man in the family replied the duke whose views of wisdom were somewhat superficial and the two branches have not intermarried since louis xivs time the connexion would be rather distant i say that is interesting i never knew that said the general however went on m de guermantes his mother i believe was the sister of the duc de montmorency and had originally been married to a la tour dauvergne but as those montmorencys are barely montmorencys while those la tour dauvergnes are not la tour dauvergnes at all i cannot see that it gives him any very great position he says and this should be more to the point that he is descended from saintrailles and as we ourselves are in a direct line of descent there was at combray a rue de saintrailles to which i had never given another thought it led from the rue de la bretonnerie to the rue de loiseau and as saintrailles the companion of joan of arc had by marrying a guermantes brought into that family the county of combray his arms were quartered with those of guermantes at the foot of one of the windows in sainthilaire i saw again a vision of dark sandstone steps while a modulation of sound brought to my ears that name guermantes in the forgotten tone in which i used to hear it long ago so different from that in which it was used to signify the genial hosts with whom i was dining this evening if the name duchesse de guermantes was for me a collective name it was so not merely in history by the accumulation of all the women who had successively borne it but also in the course of my own short life which had already seen in this single duchesse de guermantes so many different women superimpose themselves each one vanishing as soon as the next had acquired sufficient consistency words do not change their meaning as much in centuries as names do for us in the space of a few years our memory and our heart are not large enough to be able to remain faithful we have not room enough in our mental field to keep the dead there as well as the living we are obliged to build over what has gone before and is brought to light only by a chance excavation such as the name saintrailles had just wrought in my mind i felt that it would be useless to explain all this and indeed a little while earlier i had lied by implication in not answering when m de guermantes said to me you do not know our old wheedler perhaps he was quite well aware that i did know him and it was only from good breeding that he did not press the question mme de guermantes drew me out of my meditation really i find all that sort of thing too deadly listen it is not always as boring as this at my parties i hope that you will soon come and dine again as a compensation with no pedigrees next time she murmured incapable both of appreciating the kind of charm which i could find in her house and of having sufficient humility to be content to appeal to me only as a herbarium filled with plants of another day what mme de guermantes believed to be disappointing my expectations was on the contrary what in the end for the duke and the general went on to discuss pedigrees now without stopping saved my evening from becoming a complete disappointment how could i have felt otherwise until now each of my fellowguests at dinner smothering the mysterious name under which i had only at a distance known and dreamed of them with a body and with a mind similar or inferior to those of all the people i knew had given me the impression of flat vulgarity which the view on entering the danish port of elsinore would give to any passionate admirer of hamlet no doubt those geographical regions and that ancient past which put forest glades and gothic belfries into their names had in a certain measure formed their faces their intellects and their prejudices but survived in them only as does the because in the effect that is to say as a thing possible for the brain to extract but in no way perceptible to the imagination and these oldtime prejudices restored in a flash to the friends of m and mme de guermantes their vanished poetry assuredly the motions in the possession of nobles which make of them the scholars the etymologists of the language not of words but of names and this moreover relatively only to the ignorant mass of the middle classes for if at the same level of mediocrity a devout catholic would be better able to stand questioning upon the details of the liturgy than a freethinker on the other hand an anticlerical archaeologist can often give points to his parish priest on everything connected even with the latters own church those notions if we are going to confine ourselves to the truth that is to say to the spirit had not for these great gentlemen the charm that they would have had for a man of simple birth they knew perhaps better than myself that the duchesse de guise was princess of cleves of orleans and of porcien and all the rest but they had known long before they knew all these names the face of the duchesse de guise which thenceforward the names reflected back to them i had begun with the fairy were she fated shortly to perish they with the woman in middleclass families one sometimes sees jealousies spring up if the younger sister is married before the elder so the aristocratic world courvoisiers especially but guermantes also reduced its ennobled greatness to simple domestic superiorities by a system of childsplay which i had me originally and this gave it for me its sole charm in books is it not just as though tallemant des réaux were speaking of the guermantes and not of the rohans when he relates with evident satisfaction how m de guéménée cried to his brother you can come in here this is not the louvre and said of the chevalier de rohan because he was a natural son of the duc de clermont at any rate he is a prince the only thing that distressed me in all this talk was to find that the absurd stories which were being circulated about the charming hereditary grand duke of luxembourg found as much credence in this drawingroom as they had among saintloups friends plainly it was an epidemic that would not last longer than perhaps a year or two but had meanwhile infected everyone people repeated the same old stories or enriched them with others equally untrue i gathered that the princesse de luxembourg herself while apparently defending her nephew supplied weapons for the assault you are wrong to stand up for him m de guermantes told me as saintloup had told me before why without taking into consideration the opinion of our family who are unanimous about him you have only to talk to his servants and they after all are the people who know him best m de luxembourg gave his little negro page to his nephew the negro came back in tears grand duke beaten me me no bad boy grand duke naughty man it is really too much and i can speak with some knowledge he is orianes cousin i cannot by the way say how many times in the course of this evening i heard the word cousin used on the one hand m de guermantes almost at every name that was mentioned exclaimed but he is orianes cousin with the sudden joy of a man who lost in a forest reads at the ends of a pair of arrows pointing in opposite directions on a metal plate and followed by quite a low number of kilometres the words belvédere casimirperier and croix du grandveneur and gathers from them that he is on the right road on the other hand the word cousin was employed in a wholly different connexion which was here the exception to the prevailing rule by the turkish ambassadress who had come in after dinner devoured by social ambition and endowed with a real power of assimilating knowledge she would pick up with equal facility the story of the retreat of the ten thousand or the details of sexual perversion among birds it would have been impossible to stump her on any of the most recent german publications whether they dealt with political economy mental aberrations the various forms of onanism or the philosophy of epicurus she was incidentally a dangerous person to listen to for perpetually in error she would point out to you as being of the loosest morals women of irreproachable virtue would put you on your guard against a gentleman whose intentions were perfectly honourable and would tell you anecdotes of the sort that seem always to have come out of a book not so much because they are serious as because they are so wildly improbable she was at this period little received in society she had been going for some weeks now to the houses of women of real social brilliance such as the duchesse de guermantes but as a general rule had confined herself of necessity in the noblest families to obscure scions whom the guermantes had ceased to know she hoped to give herself a really fashionable air by quoting the most historic names of the littleknown people who were her friends at once m de guermantes thinking that she was referring to people who frequently dined at his table quivered with joy at finding himself once more in sight of a landmark and shouted the rallyingcry but he is orianes cousin i know him as well as i know my own name he lives in the rue vaneau his mother was mlle duzés the ambassadress was obliged to admit that her specimen had been drawn from smaller game she tried to connect her friends with those of m de guermantes by cutting across his track i know quite well who you mean no it is not those ones they are cousins but this crosscurrent launched by the unfortunate ambassadress ran but a little way for m de guermantes losing interest answered oh then i do not know who you are talking about the ambassadress offered no reply for if she never knew anyone nearer than the cousins of those whom she ought to have known in person very often these cousins were not even related at all then from the lips of m de guermantes would flow a fresh wave of but she is orianes cousin words which seemed to have for the duke the same practical value as certain epithets convenient to the roman poets because they provided them with dactyls or spondees for their hexameters at least the explosion of but she is orianes cousin appeared to me quite natural when applied to the princesse de guermantes who was indeed very closely related to the duchess the ambassadress did not seem to care for this princess she said to me in an undertone she is stupid no she is not so beautiful as all that that claim is usurped anyhow she went on with an air at once reflective rejecting and decided i find her most uncongenial but often the cousinship extended a great deal further than this mme de guermantes making it a point of honour to address as aunt ladies with whom it would have been impossible to find her an ancestress in common without going back at least to louis xv just as whenever the hardness of the times brought it about that a multimillionairess married a prince whose greatgreatgrandfather had espoused as had orianes also a daughter of louvois one of the chief joys of the fair american was to be able after a first visit to the hôtel de guermantes where she was incidentally more or less coldly received and hotly crossexamined to say aunt to mme de guermantes who allowed her to do so with a maternal smile but little did it concern me what birth meant for m de guermantes and m de monserfeuil in the conversations which they held on the subject i sought only for a poetic pleasure without being conscious of it themselves they procured me this pleasure as might a couple of labourers or sailors speaking of the soil or the tides realities too little detached from their own lives for them to be capable of enjoying the beauty which personally i proceeded to extract from them sometimes rather than of a race it was of a particular fact of a date that a name reminded me hearing m de guermantes recall that m de bréautés mother had been a choiseul and his grandmother a lucinge i fancied i could see beneath the commonplace shirt with its plain pearl studs bleeding still in two globes of crystal those august relics the hearts of mme de praslin and of the duc de berri others were more voluptuous the fine and flowing hair of mme de tallien or mme de sabran better informed than his wife as to what their ancestors had been m de guermantes found himself the possessor of memories which gave to his conversation a fine air of an ancient mansion stripped of its real treasures but still full of pictures authentic indifferent and majestic which taken as a whole look remarkably well the prince dagrigente having asked why prince von had said in speaking of the due daumale my uncle m de guermantes had replied because his mothers brother the duke of wurttemberg married a daughter of louisphilippe at once i was lost in contemplation of a casket such as carpaccio or memling used to paint from its first panel in which the princess at the wedding festivities of her brother the duc dorléans appeared wearing a plain garden dress to indicate her resentment at having seen the return emptyhanded of the ambassadors who had been sent to sue on her behalf for the hand of the prince of syracuse down to the last in which she had just given birth to a son the duke of württemberg the first cousin of the prince whom i had met at dinner in that castle called fantaisie one of those places which are as aristocratic as certain families they moreover outlasting a single generation of men see attached to themselves more than one historical personage in this one especially survive side by side memories of the margravine of bayreuth of this other somewhat fantastic princess the duc dorléanss sister to whom it was said that the name of her husbands castle made a distinct appeal of the king of bavaria and finally of prince von to whom it was simply his own postal address at which he had just asked the duc de guermantes to write to him for he had succeeded to it and let it only during the wagner festivals to the prince de polignac another delightful fantasist when m de guermantes to explain how he was related to mme darpajon was obliged going so far and so simply to climb the chain formed by the joined hands of three or five ancestresses back to marielouise or colbert it was still the same thing in each case a great historical event appeared only in passing masked unnatural reduced in the name of a property in the christian names of a woman so selected because she was the granddaughter of louisphilippe and marieamélie considered no longer as king and queen of the french but merely in the extent to which in their capacity as grandparents they bequeathed a heritage we see for other reasons in a gazetteer of the works of balzac where the most illustrious personages figure only according to their connexion with the comédie humaine napoleon occupy a space considerably less than that allotted to rastignac and occupy that space solely because he once spoke to the young ladies of cinqcygne similarly the aristocracy in its heavy structure pierced with rare windows admitting a scanty daylight shewing the same incapacity to soar but also the same massive and blind force as the architecture of the romanesque age embodies all our history immures it beetles over it thus the empty spaces of my memory were covered by degrees with names which in taking order in composing themselves with relation to one another in linking themselves to one another by an increasingly numerous connexion resembled those finished works of art in which there is not one touch that is isolated in which every part in turn receives from the rest a justification which it confers on them m de luxembourgs name having come up again in the course of the conversation the turkish ambassadress told us how the young brides grandfather he who had made that immense fortune out of flour and cereals having invited m de luxembourg to luncheon the latter had written to decline putting on the envelope m soandso miller to which the grandfather had replied i am all the more disappointed that you were not able to come my dear friend because i should have been able to enjoy your society quite intimately for we were quite an intimate party just ourselves and there would have been only the miller his son and you this story was not merely utterly distasteful to me who knew the impossibility of my dear m de nassaus writing to the grandfather of his wife whose fortune moreover he was expecting to inherit and addressing him as miller but furthermore its stupidity became glaring from the start the word miller having obviously been dragged in only to lead up to the title of la fontaines fable but there is in the faubourg saintgermain a silliness so great when it is aggravated by malice that they decided that the letter had been sent and that the grandfather as to whom at once everyone confidently declared that he was a remarkable man had shewn a prettier wit than his grandsoninlaw the duc de châtellerault tried to take advantage of this story to tell the one that i had heard in the café everyone had to lie down but scarcely had he begun or reported m de luxembourgs pretension that in his wifes presence m de guermantes ought to stand up when the duchess stopped him with the protest no he is very absurd but not as bad as that i was privately convinced that all these stories at the expense of m de luxembourg were equally untrue and that whenever i found myself face to face with any of th reputed actors or spectators i should hear the same contradiction i asked myself nevertheless whether the contradiction just uttered by mme de guermantes had been inspired by regard for truth or by selfesteem in either event the latter quality succumbed to malice for she went on with a laugh not that i have not had my little fling at him too for he invited me to luncheon wishing to make me know the grand duchess of luxembourg which is how he has the good taste to describe his wife when he is writing to his aunt i sent a reply expressing my regret and adding as for the grand duchess of luxembourg in inverted commas tell her that if she is coming to see me i am at home every thursday after five i have even had another little fling happening to be at luxembourg i telephoned asking him to ring me up his highness was going to luncheon had just risen from luncheon two hours went by and nothing happened so then i employed another method will you tell the comte de nassau to come and speak to me cut to the quick he was at the instrument that very minute everyone laughed at the duchesss story and at other analogous that is to say i am convinced of it equally untrue stories for a man more intelligent better more refined in a word more exquisite than this luxembourgnassau i have never met the sequel will shew that it was i who was in the right i must admit that in the midst of her onslaught mme de guermantes had still a kind word for him he was not always like that she informed us before he went off his head like the man in the storybook who thinks he is become king he was no fool and indeed in the early days of his engagement he used to speak of it in really quite a nice way as something he could never have dreamed of it is just like a fairytale i shall have to make my entry into luxembourg in a fairy coach he said to his uncle dornessan who answered for you know it is not a very big place luxembourg a fairy coach i am afraid my dear fellow you would never get it in i should suggest that you take a goat carriage not only did this not annoy nassau but he was the first to tell us the story and to laugh at it ornessan is a witty fellow and he is every rea son to be his mother was a montjeu lies in a very bad way now poor ornessan this name had the magic virtue of interrupting the flow of stale witticisms which otherwise would have gone on for ever in fact m de guermantes had to explain that m dornessans greatgrandmother had been the sister of marie de castille montjeu the wife of timoléon de lorraine and consequently orianes aunt with the result that the conversation drifted back to genealogies while the idiot of a turkish ambassadress breathed in my ear you appear to be very much in the dukes good books have a care and on my demanding an explanation i mean to say you understand what i mean he is a man to whom one could safely entrust ones daughter but not ones son now if ever on the contrary a man existed who was passionately and exclusively a lover of women it was certainly the duc de guermantes the state of error the falsehood fatuously believed to be the truth were for the ambassadress like a vital element out of which she could not move his brother mémé who is as it happens for other reasons altogether he did not bow to her profoundly uncongenial to me is genuinely distressed by the dukes morals so is their aunt villeparisis ah now her i adore there is a saint of a woman for you the true type of the great ladies of the past it is not only her actual virtue that is so wonderful but her restraint she still says monsieur to the ambassador norpois whom she sees every day and who by the way left an excellent impression behind him in turkey i did not even reply to the ambassadress in order to listen to the genealogies they were not all of them important there came up indeed in the course of the conversation one of those unexpected alliances which m de guermantes informed me was a misalliance but not without charm for uniting under the july monarchy the duc de guermantes and the duc de fezensac with the two irresistible daughters of an eminent navigator it gave the two duchesses the exciting novelty of a grace exotically middleclass louisphilippically indian or else under louis xiv a norpois had married the daughter of the duc de mortenart whose illustrious title struck in the remoteness of that epoch the name which i had found colourless and might have supposed to be modern of norpois carving deeply upon it the beauty of an old medal and in these cases moreover it was not only the less wellknown name that benefited by the association the other grown commonplace by the fact of its lustre struck me more forcibly in this novel and more obscure aspect just as among the portraits painted by a brilliant colourist the most striking is sometimes one that is all in black the sudden mobility with which all these names seemed to me to have been endowed as they sprang to take their places by the side of others from which i should have supposed them to be remote was due not to my ignorance alone the countrydances which they were performing in my mind they had carried out no less spontaneously at those epochs in which a title being always attached to a piece of land used to follow it from one family to another so much so that for example in the fine feudal structure that is the title of duc de nemours or duc de chevreuse i was able to discover successively hidden as in the hospitable abode of a hermitcrab a guise a prince of savoy an orléans a luynes sometimes several remained in competition for a single she will for the principality of orange the royal house of the netherlands and mm de maillynesle for the duchy of brabant the baron de charlus and the royal house of belgium various others for the titles of prince of naples duke of parma duke of reggio sometimes it was the other way the she will had been so long uninhabited by proprietors long since dead that it had never occurred to me that this or that name of a country house could have been at an epoch which after all was comparatively recent the name of a family and so when m de guermantes replied to a question put to him by m de monserfeuil no my cousin was a fanatical royalist she was the daughter of the marquis de féterne who played a certain part in the chouan rising on seeing this name féterne which had been for me since my stay at balbec the name of a country house become what i had never dreamed that it could possibly be a family name i felt the same astonishment as in reading a fairytale where turrets and a terrace come to life and turn into men and women in this sense of the words we may say that history even mere family history gives life to the old stones of a house there have been in parisian society men who played as considerable a part in it who were more sought after for their distinction or for their wit who were equally well born as the duc de guermantes or the duc de la trémoille they have now fallen into oblivion because as they left no descendants their name which we no longer hear sounds like a name unknown at most the name of a thing beneath which we never think to discover the name of any person it survives in some country house some remote village the day is not distant when the traveller who in the heart of burgundy stops in the little village of charlus to look at its church if he has not sufficient industry or is in too great a hurry to examine its tombstones will go away ignorant that this name charlus was that of a man who ranked with the highest in the land this thought reminded me that it was time to go and that while i was listening to m de guermantes talking pedigrees the hour was approaching at which i had promised to call upon his brother who knows i continued to muse whether one day guermantes itself may not appear nothing more than a placename save to the archaeologists who stopping by chance at combray and standing beneath the window of gilbert the bad have the patience to listen to the account given them by theodores successor or to read the cures guide but so long as a great name is not extinct it keeps in the full light of day those men and women who bear it and there can be no doubt that to a certain extent the interest which the illustriousness of these families gave them in my eyes lay in the fact that one can starting from today follow their ascending course step by step to a point far beyond the fourteenth century recover the diaries and correspondence of all the forebears of m de charlus of the prince dagrigente of the princesse de parme in a past in which an impenetrable night would cloak the origins of a middleclass family and in which we make out in the luminous backward projection of a name the origin and persistence of certain nervous characteristics certain vices the disorders of one or another guermantes almost identical pathologically with their namesakes of the present day they excite from century to century the startled interest of their correspondents whether these be anterior to the princess palatine and mme de motteville or subsequent to the prince de ligne however my historical curiosity was faint in comparison with my aesthetic pleasure the names cited had the effect of disincarnating the duchesss guests whom for all they might call themselves prince dagrigente or de cystira their mask of flesh and of a common intelligence or want of intelligence had transformed into ordinary mortals so much so that i had made my landing on the ducal doormat not as upon the threshold as i had supposed but as at the farthest confines of the enchanted world of names the prince dagrigente himself as soon as i heard that his mother had been a damas a granddaughter of the duke of modena was delivered as from an unstable chemical alloy from the face and speech that prevented one from recognising him and went to form with damas and modena which themselves were only titles a combination infinitely more seductive each name displaced by the attractions of another with which i had never suspected it of having any affinity left the unalterable position which it had occupied in my brain where familiarity had dulled it and speeding to join the mortemarts the stuarts or the bourbons traced with them branches of the most graceful design and an everchanging colour the name guermantes itself received from all the beautiful names extinct and so all the more glowingly rekindled with which i learned only now that it was connected a new sense and purpose purely poetical at the most at the extremity of each spray that burgeoned from the exalted stem i could see it flower in some face of a wise king or illustrious princess like the sire of henri iv or the duchesse de longueville but as these faces different in this respect from those of the party around me were not discoloured for me by any trace of physical experience or fashionable mediocrity they remained in their handsome outlines and rainbow iridescence homogeneous with those names which at regular intervals each of a different hue detached themselves from the genealogical tree of guermantes and disturbed with no foreign or opaque matter the buds pellucid alternate manycoloured which like in the old jesse windows the ancestors of jesus blossomed on either side of the tree of glass already i had made several attempts to slip away on account more than for any other reason of the triviality which my presence at it imparted to the gathering albeit it was one of those which i had long imagined as being so beautiful as it would doubtless have been had there been no inconvenient witness present at least my departure would permit the other guests once the profane intruder was no longer among them to constitute themselves at length into a secret conclave they would be free to celebrate the mysteries for the celebration of which they had met together for it could obviously not have been to talk of franz hals or of avarice and to talk of them in the same way as people talk in middleclass society they uttered nothing but trivialities doubtless because i was in the room and i felt with some compunction on seeing all these pretty women kept apart that i was preventing them by my presence from carrying on in the most precious of its drawingrooms the mysterious life of the faubourg saintgermain but this departure which i was trying at every moment to effect m and mme de guermantes carried the spirit of selfsacrifice so far as to postpone by keeping me in the room a more curious thing still several of the ladies who had come hurrying delighted beautifully dressed with constellations of jewels to be present at a party which through my fault only differed in no essential point from those that are given elsewhere than in the faubourg saintgermain any more than one feels oneself at balbec to be in a town that differs from what ones eyes are accustomed to see several of these ladies retired not at all disappointed as they had every reason to be but thanking mme de guermantes most effusively for the delightful evening which they had spent as though on the other days those on which i was not present nothing more used to occur was it really for the sake of dinners such as this that all these people dressed themselves up and refused to allow the penetration of middleclass women into their so exclusive drawingrooms for dinners such as this the same had i been absent the suspicion flashed across my mind for a moment but it was too absurd plain commonsense enabled me to brush it aside and then if i had adopted it what would have been left of the name guermantes already so degraded since combray it struck me that these flowermaidens were to a strange extent either ready to be pleased with another person or anxious to make that person pleased with them for more than one of them to whom i had not uttered during the whole course of the evening more than two or three casual remarks the stupidity of which had left me blushing made a point before leaving the drawingroom of coming to tell me fastening on me her fine caressing eyes straightening as she spoke the garland of orchids that followed the curve of her bosom what an intense pleasure it had been to her to make my acquaintance and to speak to me a veiled allusion to an invitation to dinner of her desire to arrange something after she had fixed a day with mme de guermantes none of these flower ladies left the room before the princesse de parme the presence of that lady one must never depart before royalty was one of the two reasons neither of which i had guessed for which the duchess had insisted so strongly on my remaining as soon as mme de parme had risen it was like a deliverance each of the ladies having made a genuflexion before the princess who raised her up from the ground they received from her in a kiss and like a benediction which they had craved kneeling the permission to ask for their cloaks and carriages with the result that there followed at the front door a sort of stentorian recital of great names from the history of france the princesse de parme had forbidden mme de guermantes to accompany her downstairs to the hall for fear of her catching cold and the duke had added there oriane since madam gives you leave remember what the doctor told you i am sure the princesse de parme was most pleased to take dinner with you i knew the formula the duke had come the whole way across the drawingroom in order to utter it before me with an obliging concerned air as though he were handing me a diploma or offering me a plateful of biscuits and i guessed from the pleasure which he appeared to be feeling as he spoke and which brought so sweet an expression momentarily into his face that the effort which this represented for him was of the kind which he would continue to make to the very end of his life like one of those honorific and easy posts which even when paralytic one is still allowed to retain just as i was about to leave the lady in waiting reappeared in the drawingroom having forgotten to take away some wonderful carnations sent up from guermantes which the duchess had presented to mme de parme the lady in waiting was somewhat flushed one felt that she had just been receiving a scolding for the princess so kind to everyone else could not contain her impatience at the stupidity of her attendant and so the latter picked up the flowers and ran quickly but to preserve her air of ease and independence flung at me as she passed the princess says i am keeping her waiting she wants to be gone and to have the carnations as well good lord i am not a little bird i cannot be in two places at once alas the rule of not leaving before royalty was not the only one i could not depart at once for there was another this was that the famous lavishness unknown to the courvoisiers with which the guermantes whether opulent or practically ruined excelled in entertaining their friends was not only a material lavishness of the kind that i had often experienced with robert de saintloup but also a lavish display of charming words of courteous actions a whole system of verbal elegance supplied from a positive treasurehouse within but as this last in the inactivity of fashionable existence must remain unemployed it expanded at times sought an outlet in a sort of fugitive effusion all the more intense which might in mme de guermantes have led one to suppose a genuine affection for oneself which she did for that matter feel at the moment when she let it overflow for she found then in the society of the friend man or woman with whom she happened to be a sort of intoxication in no way sensual similar to that which music produces in certain people she would suddenly detach a flower from her bodice or a medallion and present it to someone with whom she would have liked to prolong the evening with a melancholy feeling the while that such a prolongation could have led to nothing but idle talk into which nothing could have passed of the nervous pleasure the fleeting emotion similar to the first warm days of spring in the impression they leave behind them of exhaustion and regret as for the friend it did not do for him to put too implicit a faith in the promises more exhilarating than anything he had ever heard tendered by these women who because they feel with so much more force the sweetness of a moment make of it with a delicacy a nobility of which normally constituted creatures are incapable a compelling masterpiece of grace and goodness and have no longer anything of themselves left to give when the next moment has arrived their affection does not outlive the exaltation that has dictated it and the subtlety of mind which had then led them to divine all the things that you wished to hear and to say them to you will permit them just as easily a few days later to seize hold of your absurdities and use them to entertain another of their visitors with whom they will then be in the act of enjoying one of those musical moments which are so brief in the hall where i asked a footman for my snowboots which i had brought as a precaution against the snow several flakes of which had already fallen to be converted rapidly into slush not having realised that they were hardly fashionable i felt at the contemptuous smile on all sides a shame which rose to its highest pitch when i saw that mme de parme had not gone and was watching me put on my american rubbers the princess came towards me oh what a good idea she exclaimed it is so practical there is a sensible man for you madame we shall have to get a pair of those she went on to her lady in waiting while the mockery of the footmen turned to respect and the other guests crowded round me to inquire where i had managed to find these marvels with those on you will have nothing to fear even if it starts snowing again and you have a long way to go you are independent of the weather said the princess to me oh if it comes to that your royal highness can be reassured broke in the lady in waiting with a knowing air it will not snow again what do you know about it madame came witheringly from the excellent princesse de parme who alone could succeed in piercing the thick skin of her lady in waiting i can assure your royal highness it cannot snow again it is a physical impossibility but why it cannot snow any more they have taken the necessary steps to prevent it they have put down salt in the streets the simpleminded lady did not observe either the anger of the princess or the mirth of the rest of her audience for instead of remaining silent she said to me with a genial smile paying no heed to my repeated denials of any connexion with admiral jurien de la graviere not that it matters after all this gentleman must have stout sealegs what is bred in the bone then having escorted the princesse de parme to her carriage m de guermantes said to me taking hold of my greatcoat let me help you into your skin he had ceased even to smile when he employed this expression for those that were most vulgar had for that very reason because of the guermantes affectation of simplicity become aristocratic an exaltation that sank only into melancholy because it was artificial was what i also although quite differently from mme de guermantes felt once i had finally left her house in the carriage that was taking me to that of m de charlus we can at pleasure abandon ourselves to one or other of two forces of which one rises in ourselves emanates from our deepest impressions the other comes to us from without the first carries with it naturally a joy the joy that springs from the life of the creator the other current that which endeavours to introduce into us the movement by which persons external to ourselves are stirred is not accompanied by pleasure but we can add a pleasure to it by the shock of reaction in an intoxication so feigned that it turns swiftly into boredom into melancholy whence the gloomy faces of so many men of fashion and all those nervous conditions which may make them end in suicide well in the carriage which was taking me to m de charlus i was a prey to this second sort of exaltation widely different from that which is given us by a personal impression such as i had received in other carriages once at combray in dr percepieds gig from which i had seen painted against the setting sun the spires of martinville another day at balbec in mme de villeparisiss barouche when i strove to identify the reminiscence that was suggested to me by an avenue of trees but in this third carriage what i had before my minds eye were those conversations that had seemed to me so tedious at mme de guermantes dinnertable for example prince vons stories about the german emperor general botha and the british army i had slipped them into the frame of the internal stereoscope through the lenses of which once we are no longer ourselves once endowed with the spirit of society we no longer wish to receive our life save from other people we cast into relief what they have said and done like a tipsy man filled with tender feeling for the waiter who has been serving him i marvelled at my good fortune a good fortune not realised by me it is true at the actual moment in having dined with a person who knew william ii so well and had told stories about him that were upon my word really witty and as i repeated to myself with the princes german accent the story of general botha i laughed out loud as though this laugh like certain kinds of applause which increase ones inward admiration were necessary to the story as a corroboration of its comic element through the magnifying lenses even those of mme de guermantess pronouncements which had struck me as being stupid as for example that on the hals pictures which one ought to see from the top of a tramwaycar took on a life a depth that were extraordinary and i must say that even if this exaltation was quick to subside it was not altogether unreasonable just as there may always come a day when we are glad to know the person whom we despise more than anyone in the world because he happens to be connected with a girl with whom we are in love to whom he can introduce us and thus offers us both utility and gratification attributes in each of which we should have supposed him to be entirely lacking so there is no conversation any more than there are personal relations from which we can be certain that we shall not one day derive some benefit what mme de guermantes had said to me about the pictures which it would be interesting to see even from a tramwaycar was untrue but it contained a germ of truth which was of value to me later on similarly the lines of victor hugo which i had heard her quote were it must be admitted of a period earlier than that in which he became something more than a new man in which he brought to light in the order of evolution a literary species till then unknown endowed with more complex organs than any then in existence in these first poems victor hugo is still a thinker instead of contenting himself like nature with supplying food for thought his thoughts he at that time expressed in the most direct form almost in the sense in which the duke employed the word when feeling it to be out of date and a nuisance that the guests at his big parties at guermantes should in the visitors book append to their signatures a philosophicopoetical reflexion he used to warn novices in an appealing tone your name my dear fellow but no thoughts please well it was these thoughts of victor hugo almost as entirely absent from the légende des siecles as airs as melodies are from wagners later manner that mme de guermantes admired in the early hugo nor was she altogether wrong they were touching and already round about them without their forms having yet the depth which it was to acquire only in later years the rolling tide of words and of richly articulated rhymes put them beyond comparison with the lines that one might discover in a corneille for example lines in which a romanticism that is intermittent restrained and so all the more moving nevertheless has not at all penetrated to the physical sources of life modified the unconscious and generalisable organism in which the idea is latent and so i had been wrong in confining myself hitherto to the later volumes of hugo of the earlier of course it was only a fractional part that mme de guermantes used to embellish her conversation but simply by quoting in this way an isolated line one multiplies its power of attraction tenfold the lines that had entered or returned to my mind during this dinner magnetised in turn summoned to themselves with such force the poems in the heart of which they were normally embedded that my magnetised hands could not hold out for longer than fortyeight hours against the force that drew them towards the volume in which were bound up the orientales and the chants du crépuscule i cursed franchises footman for having made a present to his native village of my copy of the feuilles dautomne and sent him off with not a moment to be lost to procure me another i read these volumes from cover to cover and found peace of mind only when i suddenly came across awaiting me in the light in which she had bathed them the lines that i had heard mme de guermantes quote for all these reasons conversations with the duchess resembled the discoveries that we make in the library of a country house out of date incomplete incapable of forming a mind lacking in almost everything that we value but offering us now and then some curious scrap of information for instance the quotation of a fine passage which we did not know and as to which we are glad to remember in after years that we owe our knowledge of it to a stately mansion of the great we are then by having found balzacs preface to the chartreuse or some unpublished letters of joubert tempted to exaggerate the value of the life we led there the sterile frivolity of which for this windfall of a single evening we forget from this point of view if the fashionable world had been unable at the first moment to provide what my imagination expected and must consequently strike me first of all by what it had in common with all the other worlds rather than by its difference still it revealed itself to me by degrees as something quite distinct great noblemen are almost the only people of whom one learns as much as one does of peasants their conversation is adorned with everything that concerns the land houses as people used to live in them long ago old customs everything of which the world of money is profoundly ignorant even supposing that the aristocrat most moderate in his aspirations has finally overtaken the period in which he lives his mother his uncles his greataunts keep him in touch when he recalls his childhood with the conditions of a life almost unknown today in the deathchamber of a contemporary corpse mme de guermantes would not have pointed out but would immediately have perceived all the lapses from the traditional customs she was shocked to see at a funeral women mingling with the men when there was a particular ceremony which ought to be celebrated for the women as for the pall the use of which bloch would doubtless have believed to be confined to coffins on account of the pall bearers of whom one reads in the reports of funerals m de guermantes could remember the time when as a child he had seen it borne at the wedding of m de maillynesle while saintloup had sold his priceless genealogical tree old portraits of the bouillons letters of louis xiii in order to buy carrieres and furniture in the modern style m and mme de guermantes moved by a sentiment in which the burning love of art may have played only a minor part and which left them themselves more insignificant than before had kept their marvellous boule furniture which presented a picture attractive in a different way to an artist a literary man would similarly have been enchanted by their conversation which would have been for him for one hungry man has no need of another to keep him company a living dictionary of all those expressions which every day are becoming more and more forgotten saintjoseph cravats children dedicated to the blue and so forth which one finds today only among those people who have constituted themselves the friendly and benevolent custodians of the past the pleasure that a writer more than among other writers feels among them is not without danger for there is a risk of his coming to believe that the things of the past have a charm in themselves of his transferring them bodily into his work stillborn in that case exhaling a tedium for which he consoles himself with the reflexion it is attractive because it is true that is how people do talk these aristocratic conversations had moreover the charm with mme de guermantes of being couched in excellent french for this reason they made permissible on the duchesss part her hilarity at the words viaticum cosmic pythian preeminent which saintloup used to employ as similarly at his bing furniture when all was said very different in this respect from what i had been able to feel before the hawthorns or when i tasted a crumb of madeleine the stories that i had heard at mme de guermantess remained alien to me entering for a moment into me who was only physically possessed by them one would have said that being of a social not an individual nature they were impatient to escape i writhed in my seat in the carriage like the priestess of an oracle i looked forward to another dinnerparty at which i might myself become a sort of prince von to mme de guermantes and repeat them in the meantime they made my lips quiver as i stammered them to myself and i tried in vain to bring back and concentrate a mind that was carried away by a centrifugal force and so it was with a feverish impatience not to have to bear the whole weight of them any longer by myself in a carriage where for that matter i atoned for the lack of conversation by soliloquising aloud that i rang the bell at m de charluss door and it was in long monologues with myself in which i rehearsed everything that i was going to tell him and gave scarcely a thought to what he might have to say to me that i spent the whole of the time during which i was kept waiting in a drawingroom into which a footman shewed me and where i was incidentally too much excited to look at what it contained i felt so urgent a need that m de charlus should listen to the stories which i was burning to tell him that i was bitterly disappointed to think that the master of the house was perhaps in bed and that i might have to go home to sleep off by myself my drunkenness of words i had just noticed in fact that i had been twentyfive minutes that they had perhaps forgotten about me in this room of which despite this long wait i could at the most have said that it was very big greenish in colour and contained a large number of portraits the need to speak prevents one not merely from listening but from seeing things and in this case the absence of any description of my external surroundings is tantamount to a description of my internal state i was preparing to leave the room to try to get hold of some one and if i found no one to make my way back to the hall and have myself let out when just as i had risen from my chair and taken a few steps across the mosaic parquet of the floor a manservant came in with a troubled expression monsieur le baron has been engaged all evening sir he told me there are still several people waiting to see him i am doing everything i possibly can to get him to receive you i have already telephoned up twice to the secretary no please do not bother i had an appointment with m le baron but it is very late already and if he is busy this evening i can come back another day oh no sir you must not go away cried the servant m le baron might be vexed i will try again i was reminded of the things i had heard about m de charluss servants and their devotion to their master one could not quite say of him as of the prince de conti that he sought to give pleasure as much to the valet as to the minister but he had shewn such skill in making of the least thing that he asked of them a sort of personal favour that at night when his bodyservants assembled round him at a respectful distance after running his eye over them he said coignet the candlestick or ducret the nightshirt it was with an envious murmur that the rest used to withdraw jealous of him who had been singled out by his masters favour two of them indeed who could not abide one another used to try to snatch the favour each from his rival by going on the most flimsy pretext with a message to the baron if he had gone upstairs earlier than usual in the hope of being invested for the evening with the charge of candlestick or nightshirt if he addressed a few words directly to one of them on some subject outside the scope of his duty still more if in winter in the garden knowing that one of his coachmen had caught cold he said to him after ten minutes put your cap on the others would not speak to the fellow again for a fortnight in their jealousy of the great distinction that had been conferred on him i waited ten minutes more and then after requesting me not to stay too long as m le baron was tired and had had to send away several most important people who had made appointments with him many days before they admitted me to his presence this setting with which m de charlus surrounded himself seemed to me a great deal less impressive than the simplicity of his brother guermantes but already the door stood open i could see the baron in a chinese dressinggown with his throat bare lying upon a sofa my eye was caught at the same moment by a tall hat its nap flashing like a mirror which had been left on a chair with a cape as though the baron had but recently come in the valet withdrew i supposed that m de charlus would rise to greet me without moving a muscle he fixed on me a pair of implacable eyes i went towards him i said good evening he did not hold out his hand made no reply did not ask me to take a chair after a moments silence i asked him as one would ask an illmannered doctor whether it was necessary for me to remain standing i said this without any evil intention but my words seemed only to intensify the cold fury on m de charluss face i was not aware as it happened that at home in the country at the château de charlus he was in the habit after dinner so much did he love to play the king of sprawling in an armchair in the smokingroom letting hi guests remain standing round him he would ask for a light from one offer a cigar to another and then after a few minutes interval would say but argencourt why do not you sit down take a chair my dear fellow and so forth having made a point of keeping them standing simply to remind them that it was from himself that permission came to them to be seated put yourself in the louis xiv seat he answered me with an imperious air as though rather to force me to move away farther from himself than to invite me to be seated i took an armchair which was comparatively near ah so that is what you call a louis xiv seat is it i can see you have been well educated he cried in derision i was so much taken aback that i did not move either to leave the house as i ought to have done or to change my seat as he wished sir he next said to me weighing each of his words to the more impertinent of which he prefixed a double yoke of consonants the interview which i have condescended to grant you at the request of a person who desires to be nameless will mark the final point in our relations i shall not conceal from you that i had hoped for better things i should perhaps be forcing the sense of the words a little which one ought not to do even with people who are ignorant of their value simply out of the respect due to oneself were i to tell you that i had felt a certain attraction towards you i think however that benevolence in its most actively protecting sense would exceed neither what i felt nor what i was proposing to display i had immediately on my return to paris given you to understand while you were still at balbec that you could count upon me i who remembered with what a torrent of abuse m de charlus had parted from me at balbec made an instinctive gesture of contradiction what he cried with fury and indeed his face convulsed and white differed as much from his ordinary face as does the sea when on a morning of storm one finds instead of its customary smiling surface a thousand serpents writhing in spray and foam do you mean to pretend that you did not receive my message almost a declaration that you were to remember me what was there in the way of decoration round the cover of the book that i sent you some very pretty twined garlands with tooled ornaments i told him ah he replied with an air of scorn these young frenchmen know little of the treasures of our land what would be said of a young berliner who had never heard of the walküre besides you must have eyes to see and see not since you yourself told me that you had stood for two hours in front of that particular treasure i can see that you know no more about flowers than you do about styles do not protest that you know about styles he cried in a shrill scream of rage you cannot even tell me what you are sitting on you offer your hindquarters a directorychauffeuse as a louis xiv bergere one of these days you will be mistaking mme de villeparisiss knees for the seat of the rear and a fine mess you will make of things then it is precisely the same you did not even recognise on the binding of bergottes book the lintel of myosotis over the door of balbec church could there be any clearer way of saying to you forget me not i looked at m de charlus undoubtedly his magnificent head though repellent yet far surpassed that of any of his relatives you would have called him an apollo grown old but an olivehued bilious juice seemed ready to start from the corners of his evil mouth as for intellect one could not deny that his over a vast compass had taken in many things which must always remain unknown to his brother guermantes but whatever the fine words with which he coloured all his hatreds one felt that even if there was now an offended pride now a disappointment in love or a rancour or sadism a love of teasing a fixed obsession this man was capable of doing murder and of proving by force of logic that he had been right in doin it and was still superior by a hundred cubits in moral stature to his brother his sisterinlaw or any of the rest just as in velazquezslances he went on the victor advances towards him who is the humbler in rank as is the duty of every noble nature since i was everything and you were nothing it was i who took the first steps towards you you have made an idiotic reply to what it is not for me to describe as an act of greatness but i have not allowed myself to be discouraged our religion inculcates patience the patience i have shewn towards you will be counted i hope to my credit and also my having only smiled at what might be denounced as impertinence were it within your power to offer any impertinence to me who surpass you in stature by so many cubits but after all sir all this is now neither here nor there i have subjected you to the test which the one eminent man of our world has ingeniously named the test of excessive friendliness and which he rightly declares to be the most terrible of all the only one that can separate the good grain from the tares i could scarcely reproach you for having undergone it without success for those who emerge from it triumphant are very few but at least and this is the conclusion which i am entitled to draw from the last words that we shall exchange on this earth at least i intend to hear nothing more of your calumnious fabrications so far i had never dreamed that m de charluss rage could have been caused by an unflattering remark which had been repeated to him i searched my memory i had not spoken about him to anyone some evildoer had invented the whole thing i protested tom de charlus that i had said absolutely nothing about him i do not think i can have annoyed you by saying to mme de guermantes that i was a friend of yours he gave a disdainful smile made his voice climb to the supreme pitch of its highest register and there without strain attacking the shrillest and most insolent note oh sir he said returning by the most gradual stages to a natural intonation and seeming to revel as he went in the oddities of this descending scale i think that you are doing yourself an injustice when you accuse yourself of having said that we were friends i do not look for any great verbal accuracy in anyone who could readily mistake a piece of chippendale for a rococo chaire but really i do not believe he went on with vocal caresses that grew more and more winning and brought to hover over his lips what was actually a charming smile i do not believe that you can ever have said or thought that we were frlends as for your having boasted that you had been presented to me had talked to me knew me slightly had obtained almost without solicitation the prospect of coming one day under my protection i find it on the contrary very natural and intelligent of you to have done so the extreme difference in age that there is between us enables me to recognise without absurdity that thatpresentation those talks that vague prospect of future relations were for you it is not for me to say an honour but still when all is said and done an advantage as to which i consider that your folly lay not in divulging it but in not having had the sense to keep it i will go so far as to say he went on passing abruptly for a moment from his arrogant wrath to a gentleness so tinged with melancholy that i expected him to burst into tears that when you left unanswered the proposal i made to you here in paris it seemed to me so unheardof an act on your part coming from you who had struck me as well brought up and of a good bourgeois family on this adjective alone his voice sounded a little whistle of impertinence that i was foolish enough to imagine all the excuses that never really happen letters miscarrying addresses copied down wrong i can see that on my part it was great foolishness but saint bonaventure preferred to believe that an ox could fly rather than that his brother was capable of lying anyhow that is all finished now the idea did not attract you there is no more to be said it seems to me only that you might have brought yourself and there was a genuine sound of weeping in his voice were it only out of consideration for my age to write to me i had conceived and planned for you certain infinitely seductive things which i had taken good care not to tell you you have preferred to refuse without knowing what they were that is your affair but as i tell you one can always write in your place and indeed in my own i should have done so i like my place for that reason better than yours i say for that reason because i believe that we are all equal and i have more fellowfeeling for an intelligent labourer than for many of our dukes but i can say that i prefer my place to yours because what you have done in the whole course of my life which is beginning now to be a pretty long one i am conscious that i have never done his head was turned away from the light and i could not see if his eyes were dropping tears as i might have supposed from his voice i told you that i had taken a hundred steps towards you the only effect of that has been to make you retire two hundred from me now it is for me to withdraw and we shall know one another no longer i shall retain not your name but your story so that at moments when i might be tempted to believe that men have good hearts good manners or simply the intelligence not to allow an unparalleled opportunity to escape them i may remember that that is ranking them too highly no that you should have said that you knew me when it was true for henceforward it ceases to be true i regard that as only natural and i take it as an act of homage that is to say something pleasant unfortunately elsewhere and in other circumstances you have uttered remarks of a very different nature sir i swear to you that i have said nothing that could insult you and who says that i am insulted he cried with fury flinging himself into an erect posture on the seat on which hitherto he had been reclining motionless while as the pale frothing serpents stiffened in his face his voice became alternately shrill and grave like the deafening onrush of a storm the force with which he habitually spoke which used to make strangers turn round in the street was multiplied an hundredfold as is a musical forte if instead of being played on the piano it is played by an orchestra and changed into afortissimo as well m de charlus roared do you suppose that it is within your power to insult me you evidently are not aware to whom you are speaking do you imagine that the envenomed spittle of five hundred little gentlemen of your type heaped one upon another would succeed in slobbering so much as the tips of my august toes a moment before this my desire to persuade m de charlus that i had never said nor heard anyone else say any evil of him had given place to a mad rage caused by the words which were dictated to him solely to my mind by his colossal pride perhaps they were indeed the effect in part at any rate of this pride almost all the rest sprang from a feeling of which i was then still ignorant and for which i could not therefore be blamed for not making due allowance i could at least failing this unknown element have mingled with his pride had i remembered the words of mme de guermantes a trace of madness but at that moment the idea of madness never even entered my head there was in him according to me only pride in me there was only fury this fury at the moment when m de charlus ceased to shout in order to refer to his august toes with a majesty that was accompanied by a grimace a nausea of disgust at his obscure blasphemers this fury could contain itself no longer with an impulsive movement i wanted to strike something and a lingering trace of discernment making me respect the person of a man so much older than myself and even in view of their dignity as works of art the pieces of german porcelain that were grouped around him i flung myself upon the barons new silk hat dashed it to the ground trampled upon it began blindly pulling it to pieces wrenched off the brim tore the crown in two without heeding the vociferations of m de charlus which continued to sound and crossing the room to leave it opened the door one on either side of it to my intense stupefaction stood two footmen who moved slowly away so as to appear only to have been casually passing in the course of their duty i afterwards learned their names one was called burnier the other charmel i was not taken in for a moment by this explanation which their leisurely gait seemed to offer me it was highly improbable three others appeared to me to be less so one that the baron sometimes entertained guests against whom as he might happen to need assistance but why he deemed it necessary to keep reinforcements posted close at hand the second was that drawn by curiosity they had stopped to listen at the keyhole not thinking that i should come out so quickly the third that the whole of the scene which m de charlus had made with me having been prepared and acted he had himself told them to listen from a love of the spectacular combined perhaps with a nunc crudimini from which each would derive a suitable profit my anger had not calmed that of m de charlus my departure from the room seemed to because him acute distress he called me back made his servants call me back and finally forgetting that a moment earlier when he spoke of his august toes he had thought to make me a witness of his own deification came running after me at full speed overtook me in the hall and stood barring the door there now he said do not be childish come back for a minute he who loveth well chasteneth well and if i have chastened you well it is because i love you well my anger had subsided i let the word chasten pass and followed the baron who summoning a footman ordered him without a trace of selfconsciousness to clear away the remains of the shattered hat which was replaced by another if you will tell me sir who it is that has treacherously maligned me i said to m de charlus i will stay here to learn his name and to confute the impostor who do you not know do you retain no memory of the things you say do you think that the people who do me the service of informing me of those things do not begin by demanding secrecy and do you imagine that i am going to betray a person to whom i have given my promise sir is it impossible then for you to tell me i asked racking my brains in a final effort to discover and discovering no one to whom i could have spoken about m de charlus you did not hear me say that i had given a promise of secrecy to my informant he said in a snapping voice i see that with your fondness for abject utterances you combine one for futile persistence you ought to have at least the intelligence to profit by a final conversation and so to speak as to say something that does not mean precisely nothing sir i replied moving away from him you insult me i am unarmed because you are several times my age we are not equally matched on the other hand i cannot convince you i have already sworn to you that i have said nothing i am lying then am i he cried in a terrifying tone and with a bound forwards that brought him within a yard of myself some one has misinformed you then in a gentle affectionate melancholy voice as in those symphonies which are played without any break between the different movements in which a gracefulscherzo amiable and idyllic follows the thunderpeals of the opening pages it is quite possible he told me generally speaking a remark repeated at second hand is rarely true it is your fault if not having profited by the opportunities of seeing me which i had held out to you you have not furnished me by that open speech of daily intercourse which creates confidence with the unique and sovereign remedy against a spoken word which made you out a traitor either way true or false the remark has done its work i can never again rid myself of the impression it made on me i cannot even say that he who chasteneth well loveth well for i have chastened you well enough but i no longer love you while saying this he had forced me to sit down and had rung the bell a different footman appeared bring something to drink and order the brougham i said that i was not thirsty and besides had a carriage waiting they have probably paid him and sent him away he told me you need not worry about that i am ordering a carriage to take you home if you are anxious about the time i could have given you a room here i said that my mother would be uneasy ah of course yes well true or false the remark has done its work my affection a trifle premature had flowered too soon and like those apple trees of which you spoke so poetically at balbec it has been unable to withstand the first frost if m de charluss affection for me had not been destroyed he could hardly have acted differently since while assuring me that we were no longer acquainted he made me sit down drink asked me to stay the night and was going now to send me home he had indeed an air of dreading the moment at which he must part from me and find himself alone that sort of slightly anxious fear which his sisterinlaw and cousin guermantes had appeared to me to be feeling when she had tried to force me to stay a little longer with something of the same momentary fondness for myself of the same effort to prolong the passing minute unfortunately he went on i have not the power to make blossom again what has once been destroyed my affection for you is quite dead nothing can revive it i believe that it is not unworthy of me to confess that i regret it i always feel myself to be a little like victor hugos boaz i am widowed and alone and the darkness gathers over me i passed again with him through the big green drawingroom i told him speaking quite at random how beautiful i thought it are not it he replied it is a good thing to be fond of something the woodwork is bagard what is rather charming dyou see is that it was made to match the beauvais chairs and the consoles you observe it repeats the same decorative design there used to be only two places where you could see this the louvre and m dhinnisdals house but naturally as soon as i had decided to come and live in this street there cropped up an old family house of the chimays which nobody had ever seen before because it came here expressly for me on the whole it is good it might perhaps be better but after all it is not bad some pretty things are not there these are portraits of my uncles the king of poland and the king of england by mignard but why am i telling you all this you must know it as well as i do you were waiting in this room no ah then they must have put you in the blue drawingroom he said with an air that might have been either impertinence on the score of my want of interest or personal superiority in not having taken the trouble to ask where i had been kept waiting look now in this cabinet i have all the hats worn by mlle elisabeth by the princesse de lamballe and by the queen they do not interest you one would think you could not see perhaps you are suffering from an affection of the optic nerve if you like this kind of beauty better here is a rainbow by turner beginning to shine out between these two rembrandts as a sign of our reconciliation you hear beethoven has come to join him and indeed one could hear the first chords of the third part of the pastoral symphony joy after the storm performed somewhere not far away on the first landing no doubt by a band of musicians i innocently inquired how they happened to be playing that and who the musicians were ah well one does not know one never does know they are unseen music pretty are not it he said to me in a slightly impertinent tone which nevertheless suggested somehow the influence and accent of swann but you care about as much for it as a fish does for little apples you want to go home regardless of any want of respect for beethoven or for me you are uttering your own judgment and condemnation he added with an affectionate and mournful air when the moment had come for me to go you will excuse my not accompanying you home as good manners ordain that i should he said to me since i have decided not to see you again spending five minutes more in your company would make very little difference to me but i am tired and i have a great deal to do and then seeing that it was a fine night very well yes i will come in the carriage there is a superb moon which i shall go on to admire from the bois after i have taken you home what you do not know how to shave even on a night when you have been dining out you have still a few hairs here he said taking my chin between two fingers so to speak magnetised which after a moments resistance ran up to my ears like the fingers of a barber ah it would be pleasant to look at the blue light of the moon in the bois with some one like yourself he said to me with a sudden and almost involuntary gentleness then in a sadder tone for you are nice all the same you could be nicer than anyone he went on laying his hand in a fatherly way on my shoulder originally i must say that i found you quite insignificant i ought to have reflected that he must find me so still i had only to recall the rage with which he had spoken to me barely half an hour before in spite of this i had the impression that he was for the moment sincere that his kindness of heart was prevailing over what i regarded as an almost delirious condition of susceptibility and pride the carriage was waiting beside us and still he prolonged the conversation come along he said abruptly jump in in five minutes we shall be at your door and i shall bid you a good night which will cut short our relations and for all time it is better since we must part for ever that we should do so as in music on a perfect chord despite these solemn affirmations that we should never see one another again i could have sworn that m de charlus annoyed at having forgotten himself earlier in the evening and afraid of having hurt my feelings would not have been displeased to see me once again nor was i mistaken for a moment later there now he said if i had not forgotten the most important thing of all in memory of your grandmother i have had bound for you a curious edition of mme de sévigné that is what is going to prevent this from being our last meeting one must console oneself with the reflexion that complicated affairs are rarely settled in a day just look how long they took over the congress of vienna but i could call for it without disturbing you i said obligingly will you hold your tongue you little fool he replied with anger and not give yourself a grotesque appearance of regarding as a small matter the honour of being probably i do not say certainly for it will perhaps be one of my servants who hands you the volumes received by me then regaining possession of himself i do not wish to part from you on these words no dissonance before the eternal silence of the dominant it was for his own nerves that he seemed to dread an immediate return home after harsh words of dissension you would not care to come to the bois he addressed me in a tone not so much interrogative as affirmative and that not as it seemed to me because he did not wish to make me the offer but because he was afraid that his selfesteem might meet with a refusal oh very well he went on still postponing our separation it is the moment when as whistler says the bourgeois go to bed perhaps he wished now to capture me by my selfesteem and the right time to begin to look at things but you do not even know who whistler was i changed the conversation and asked him whether the princesse diéna was an intelligent person m de charlus stopped me and adopting the most contemptuous tone that i had yet heard him use oh there sir he informed me you are alluding to an order of nomenclature with which i have no concern there is perhaps an aristocracy among the tahitians but i must confess that i know nothing about it the name which you have just mentioned strangely enough did sound in my ears only a few days ago some one asked me whether i would condescend to allow them to present to me the young duc de guastalla the request astonished me for the duc de guastalla has no need to get himself presented to me for the simple reason that he is my cousin and has known me all his life he is the son of the princesse de parme and as a young kinsman of good upbringing he never fails to come and pay his respects to me on new years day but on making inquiries i discovered that it was not my relative who was meant but the son of the person in whom you are interested as there exists no princess of that title i supposed that my friend was referring to some poor wanton sleeping under the pont diéna who had picturesquely assumed the title of princesse diéna just as one talks about the panther of the batignolles or the steel king but no the reference was to a rich person who possesses some remarkable furniture which i had seen and admired at an exhibition and which has this advantage over the name of its owner that it is genuine as for this selfstyled duc de guastalla he i supposed must be my secretarys stockbroker one can procure so many things with money but no it was the emperor it appears who amused himself by conferring on these people a title which simply was not his to give it was perhaps a sign of power or of ignorance or of malice in any case i consider it was an exceedingly scurvy trick to play on these unconscious usurpers but really i cannot help you by throwing any light on the matter my knowledge begins and ends with the faubourg saintgermain where among all the courvoisiers and gallardons you will find if you can manage to secure an introduction plenty of mangy old cats taken straight out of balzac who will amuse you naturally all that has nothing to do with the position of the princesse de guermantes but without me and my open sesame her portals are unapproachable it is really very lovely is not it sir the princesse de guermantess mansion oh it is not very lovely it is the loveliest thing in the world next to the princess herself of course the princesse de guermantes is better than the duchesse de guermantes oh there is no comparison it is to be observed that whenever people in society have the least touch of imagination they will crown or dethrone to suit their affections or their quarrels those whose position appeared most solid and unalterably fixed the duchesse de guermantes possibly in not calling her oriane he wished to set a greater distance between her and myself is delightful far superior to anything you can have guessed but after all she is incommensurable with her cousin the princess is exactly what the people in the markets might imagine princess metternich to have been but old metternich believed she had started wagner because she knew victor maurel the princesse de guermantes or rather her mother knew the man himself which is a distinction not to mention the incredible beauty of the lady and the esther gardens alone one cannot see them no you would have to be invited but they never invite anyone unless i intervene but at once withdrawing after casting it at me the bait of this offer he held out his hand for we had reached my door my part is played sir i will simply add these few words another person will perhaps some day offer you his affection as i have done let the present example serve for your instruction do not neglect it affection is always precious what one cannot do by oneself in this life because there are things which one cannot ask nor do nor wish nor learn by oneself one can do in company and without needing to be thirteen as in balzacs story or four as in the three musketeers goodbye he must have been feeling tired and have abandoned the idea of going to look at the moonlight for he asked me to tell his coachman to drive home at once he made a sharp movement as though he had changed his mind but i had already given the order and so as not to lose any more time went across now to ring the bell without its entering my head that i had been meaning to tell m de charlus about the german emperor and general botha stories which had been an hour ago such an obsession but which his unexpected and crushing reception had sent flying far out of my mind on entering my room i saw on my desk a letter which franchises young footman had written to one of his friends and had left lying there now that my mother was away there was no liberty which he had the least hesitation in taking i was the more to blame of the two for taking that of reading the letter which without an envelope lay spread out before me and which was my sole excuse seemed to offer itself to my eye dear friend and cousin i hope this finds you in good health and the same with all the young folk particularly my young godson joseph whom i have not yet had the pleasure of meeting but whom i prefer to you all as being my godson these relics of the heart they have their dust also upon their blest remains let us not lay our hands besides dear friend and cousin who can say that tomorrow you and your dear wife my cousin marie will not both of you be cast headlong down into the bottom of the sea like the sailor clinging to the mast on high for this life is but a dark valley dear friend i must tell you that my principal occupation which will astonish you i am certain is now poetry which i love passionately for one must somehow pass the time away and so dear friend do not be too surprised if i have not answered your last letter before now in place of pardon let oblivion come as you are aware madames mother has passed away amid unspeakable sufferings which fairly exhausted her as she saw as many as three doctors the day of her interment was a great day for all monsieurs relations came in crowds as well as several ministers it took them more than two hours to get to the cemetery which will make you all open your eyes pretty wide in your village for they certainly will not do as much for mother michu so all my life to come can be but one long sob i am amusing myself enormously with the motorcycle of which i have recently learned what would you say my dear friends if i arrived suddenly like that at full speed at les ecorces but on that head i shall no more keep silence for i feel that the frenzy of grief sweeps its reason away i am associating with the duchesse de guermantes people whose very names you have never heard in our ignorant villages therefore it is with pleasure that i am going to send the works of racine of victor hugo of pages choisies de chenedolle of alfred de musset for i would cure the land in which i saw the light of ignorance which leads unerringly to crime i can think of nothing more to say to you and send you like the pelican wearied by a long flight my best regards as well as to your wife my godson and your sister rose may it never be said of her and rose she lived only as live the roses as has been said by victor hugo the sonnet of arvers alfred de musset all those great geniuses who for that because have had to die upon the blazing scaffold like jeanne darc hoping for your next letter soon receive my kisses like those of a brother périgot joseph we are attracted by every form of life which represents to us something unknown and strange by a last illusion still unshattered in spite of this the mysterious utterances by means of which m de charlus had led me to imagine the princesse de guermantes as an extraordinary creature different from anyone that i knew were not sufficient to account for the stupefaction in which i was plunged speedily followed by the fear that i might be the victim of some bad joke planned by some one who wanted to send me to the door of a house to which i had not been invited when about two months after my dinner with the duchess and while she was at cannes having opened an envelope the appearance of which had not led me to suppose that it contained anything out of the common i read the following words engraved on a card the princesse de guermantesnée duchesse en baviere at home the th no doubt to be invited to the princesse de guermantess was perhaps not from the social point of view any more difficult than to dine with the duchess and my slight knowledge of heraldry had taught me that the title of prince is not superior to that of duke besides i told myself that the intelligence of a society woman could not be essentially so heterogeneous to that of her congeners as m de charlus made out nor so heterogeneous to that of any one other woman in society but my imagination like elstir engaged upon rendering some effect of perspective without reference to a knowledge of the laws of nature which he might quite well possess depicted for me not what i knew but what it saw what it saw that is to say what the name shewed it now even before i had met the duchess the name guermantes preceded by the title of princess like a note or a colour or quantity profoundly modified from the surrounding values by the mathematical or aesthetic sign that governs it had already suggested to me something entirely different with that title one finds ones thoughts straying instinctively to the memoirs of the days of louis xiii and louis xiv the english court the queen of scots the duchesse daumale and i imagined the town house of the princesse de guermantes as more or less frequented by the duchesse de longueville and the great condé whose presence there rendered it highly improbable that i should ever make my way into it many of the things that m de charlus had told me had driven a vigorous spur into my imagination and making it forget how much the reality had disappointed me at mme de guermantess peoples names are in this respect like the names of places had swung it towards orianes cousin for that matter m de charlus misled me at times as to the imaginary value and variety of people in society only because he was himself at times misled and this perhaps because he did nothing did not write did not paint did not even read anything in a serious and thorough manner but superior by several degrees to the people in society if it was from them and the spectacle they afforded that he drew the material for his conversation he was not for that reason understood by them speaking as an artist he could at the most reveal the fallacious charm of people in society but reveal it to artists alone with relation to whom he might be said to play the part played by the reindeer among the esquimaux this precious animal plucks for them from the barren rocks lichens and mosses which they themselves could neither discover nor utilise but which once they have been digested by the reindeer become for the inhabitants of the far north a nourishing form of food to which i may add that the pictures which m de charlus drew of society were animated with plenty of life by the blend of his ferocious hatreds and his passionate affections hatreds directed mainly against the young men adoration aroused principally by certain women if among these the princesse de guermantes was placed by m de charlus upon the most exalted throne his mysterious words about the unapproachable aladdins palace in which his cousin dwelt were not sufficient to account for my stupefaction apart from whatever may be due to the divers subjective points of view of which i shall have to speak later in these artificial magnifications the fact remains that there is a certain objective reality in each of these people and consequently a difference among them and how when it comes to that could it be otherwise the humanity with which we consort and which bears so little resemblance to our dreams is for all that the same that in the memoirs in the letters of eminent persons we have seen described and have felt a desire to know the old man of complete insignificance whom we met at dinner is the same who wrote that proud letter which in a book on the war of we read with emotion to prince friedrichkarl we are bored at a dinnertable because our imagination is absent and because it is bearing us company we are interested in a book but the people in question are the same we should like to have known mme de pompadour who was so valuable a patron of the arts and we should have been as much bored in her company as among the modern egerias at whose houses we cannot bring ourselves to pay a second call so uninteresting do we find them the fact remains nevertheless that these differences do exist people are never exactly similar to one another their mode of behaviour with regard to ourselves at one might say the same level of friendship reveals differences which in the end offer compensations when i knew mme de montmorency she loved to say unpleasant things to me but if i was in need of a service she would squander in the hope of obtaining it for me effectively all the credit at her disposal without counting the cost whereas some other woman mme de guermantes for example would never have wished to hurt my feelings never said anything about me except what might give me pleasure showered on me all those tokens of friendship which formed the rich manner of living morally of the guermantes but had i asked her for the least thing above and beyond that would not have moved an inch to procure it for me as in those country houses where one has at ones disposal a motorcar and a special footman but where it is impossible to obtain a glass of cider for which no provision has been made in the arrangements for a party which was for me the true friend mme de montmorency so glad always to annoy me and always so ready to oblige or mme de guermantes distressed by the slightest offence that might have been given me and incapable of the slightest effort to be of use to me the types of the human mind are so varied so opposite not only in literature but in society that baudelaire and mérimée are not the only people who have the right to despise one another mutually these peculiarities continue to form in everyone a system of attitudes of speech of actions so coherent so despotic that when we are in the presence of anyone his or her system seems to us superior to the rest with mme de guermantes her words deduced like a theorem from her type of mind seemed to me the only ones that could possibly be said and i was at heart of her opinion when she told me that mme de montmorency was stupid and kept an open mind towards all the things she did not understand or when having heard of some spiteful remark by that lady she said that is what you call a good woman it is what i call a monster but this tyranny of the reality which confronts us this preponderance of the lamplight which turns the dawn already distant as pale as the faintest memory disappeared when i was away from mme de guermantes and a different lady said to me putting herself on my level and reckoning the duchess as placed far below either of us oriane takes no interest really in anything or anybody or even what in the presence of mme de guermantes it would have seemed impossible to believe so loudly did she herself proclaim the opposite oriane is a snob seeing that no mathematical process would have enabled one to convert mme darpajon and mme de montpensier into commensurable quantities it would have been impossible for me to reply had anyone asked me which of the two seemed to me superior to the other now among the peculiar characteristics of the drawingroom of the princesse de guermantes the one most generally quoted was a certain exclusiveness due in part to the royal birth of the princess but especially to the almost fossilised rigidity of the aristocratic prejudices of the prince prejudices which incidentally the duke and duchess had made no scruple about deriding in front of me and which naturally were to make me regard it as more improbable than ever that i should have been invited to a party by this man who reckoned only in royalties and dukes and at every dinnerparty made a scene because he had not been put in the place to which he would have been entitled under louis xiv a place which thanks to his immense erudition in matters of history and genealogy he was the only person who knew for this reason many of the people in society placed to the credit of the duke and duchess the differences which distinguished them from their cousins the duke and duchess are far more modern far more intelligent they do not think of nothing like the other couple but how many quarterings one has their house is three hundred years in advance of their cousins were customary remarks the memory of which made me tremble as i looked at the card of invitation to which they gave a far greater probability of its having been sent me by some practical joker if the duke and duchess had not been still at cannes i might have tried to find out from them whether the invitation which i had received was genuine this state of doubt in which i was plunged was not due as i flattered myself for a time by supposing to a sentiment which a man of fashion would not have felt and which consequently a writer even if he belonged apart from his writership to the fashionable caste ought to reproduce in order to be thoroughly objective and to depict each class differently i happened in fact only the other day in a charming volume of memoirs to come upon the record of uncertainties analogous to those which the princesse de guermantess card made me undergo georges and i or hély and i i have not the book at hand to verify the reference were so keen to be asked to mme delesserts that having received an invitation from her we thought it prudent each of us independently to make certain that we were not the victims of an april fool now the writer is none other than the comte dhaussonville he who married the duc de broglies daughter and the other young man who independently makes sure that he is not having a practical joke played on him is according to whether he is called georges or hély one or other of the two inseparable friends of m dhaussonville either m dharcourt or the prince de chalais the day on which the party was to be given at the princesse de guermantess i learned that the duke and duchess had just returned to paris the princesss ball would not have brought them back but one of their cousins was seriously ill and moreover the duke was greatly taken up with a revel which was to be held the same night and at which he himself was to appear as louis xi and his wife as isabel of bavaria and i determined to go and see her that morning but having gone out early they had not yet returned i watched first of all from a little room which had seemed to me to be a good lookout post for the arrival of their carriage as a matter of fact i had made a singularly bad choice in my observatory from which i could barely make out our courtyard but i did see into several others and this though of no value to me occupied my mind for a time it is not only in venice that one has those outlooks on to several houses at once which have proved so tempting to painters it is just the same in paris nor do i cite venice at random it is of its poorer quarters that certain poor quarters of paris make one think in the morning with their tall wide chimneys to which the sun imparts the most vivid pinks the brightest reds it is a whole garden that flowers above the houses and flowers in such a variety of tints that one would call it planted on top of the town the garden of a tulipfancier of delft or haarlem and then also the extreme proximity of the houses with their windows looking opposite one another on to a common courtyard makes of each casement the frame in which a cook sits dreamily gazing down at the ground below in which farther off a girl is having her hair combed by an old woman with the face barely distinguishable in the shadow of a witch thus each courtyard provides for the adjoining house by suppressing all sound in its interval by leaving visible a series of silent gestures in a series of rectangular frames glazed by the closing of the windows an exhibition of a hundred dutch paintings hung in rows certainly from the hôtel de guermantes one did not have the same kind of view but one had curious views also especially from the strange trigonometrical point at which i had placed myself and from which ones gaze was arrested by nothing nearer than the distant heights formed by the comparatively vague plots of ground which preceded on a steep slope the mansion of the marquise de plassac and mme de tresmes cousins of the most noble category of m de guermantes whom i did not know between me and this house which was that of their father m de bréquigny nothing but blocks of buildings of low elevation facing in every conceivable direction which without blocking the view increased the distance with their diagonal perspective the redtiled turret of the coachhouse in which the marquis de frécourt kept his carriages did indeed end in a spire that rose rather higher but was so slender that it concealed nothing and made one think of those picturesque old buildings in switzerland which spring up in isolation at the foot of a mountain all these vague and divergent points on which my eyes rested made more distant apparently than if it had been separated from us by several streets or by a series of foothills the house of mme de plassac actually quite near but chimerically remote as in an alpine landscape when its large paned windows glittering in the sunlight like flakes of rock crystal were thrown open so as to air the rooms one felt in following from one floor to the next the footmen whom it was impossible to see clearly but who were visibly shaking carpets the same pleasure as when one sees in a landscape by turner or elstir a traveller in a mailcoach or a guide at different degrees of altitude on the saintgothard but from this point of view in which i had ensconced myself i should have been in danger of not seeing m or mme de guermantes come in so that when in the afternoon i was free to resume my survey i simply stood on the staircase from which the opening of the carriagegate could not escape my notice and it was on this staircase that i posted myself albeit there did not appear there so entrancing with their footmen rendered minute by distance and busily cleaning the alpine beauties of the bréquignytresmes mansion now this wait on the staircase was to have for me consequences so considerable and to reveal to me a picture no longer turneresque but ethical of so great importance that it is preferable to postpone the account of it for a little while by interposing first that of my visit to the guermantes when i knew that they had come home it was the duke alone who received me in the library as i went in there came out a little man with snowwhite hair a look of poverty a little black neckcloth such as was worn by the lawyer at combray and by several of my grandfathers friends but of a more timid aspect than they who making me a series of profound bows refused absolutely to go downstairs until i had passed him the duke shouted after him from the library something which i did not understand and the other responded with further bows addressed to the wall for the duke could not see him but endlessly repeated nevertheless like the purposeless smiles on the faces of people who are talking to one over the telephone he had a falsetto voice and saluted me afresh with the humility of a man of business and he might for that matter have been a man of business from combray so much was he in the style provincial out of date and mild of the small folk the modest elders of those parts you shall see oriane in a minute the duke told me when i had entered the room as swann is coming in presently and bringing her the proofs of his book on the coinage of the order of malta and what is worse an immense photograph he has had taken shewing both sides of each of the coins oriane preferred to get dressed early so that she can stay with him until it is time to go out to dinner we have such a heap of things in the house already that we do not know where to put them all and i ask myself where on earth we are going to stick this photograph but i have too goodnatured a wife who is too fond of giving people pleasure she thought it would be polite to ask swann to let her see side by side on one sheet the heads of all those grand masters of the order whose medals he has found at rhodes i said malta did not i it is rhodes but it is all the same order of saint john of jerusalem as a matter of fact she is interested in them only because swann makes a hobby of it our family is very much mixed up in the whole story even at the present day my brother whom you know is one of the highest dignitaries in the order of malta but i might have told all that to oriane she simply would not have listened to me on the other hand it was quite enough that swanns researches into the templars it is astonishing the passion that people of one religion have for studying others should have led him on to the history of the knights of rhodes who succeeded the templars for oriane at once to insist on seeing the heads of these knights they were very small fry indeed compared with the lusignans kings of cyprus from whom we descend in a direct line but so far as swann has not taken them up oriane does not care to hear anything about the lusignans i could not at once explain to the duke why i had come what happened was that several relatives or friends including mme de silistrie and the duchesse de montrose came to pay a call on the duchess who was often at home before dinner and not finding her there stayed for a short while with the duke the first of these ladies the princesse de silistrie simply attired with a dry but friendly manner carried a stick in her hand i was afraid at first that she had injured herself or was a cripple she was on the contrary most alert she spoke regretfully to the duke of a first cousin of his own not on the guermantes side but more illustrious still were that possible whose health which had been in a grave condition for some time past had grown suddenly worse but it was evident that the duke while full of pity for his cousins lot and repeating poor mama he is such a good fellow had formed a favourable prognosis the fact was that the dinner at which the duke was to be present amused him the big party at the princesse de guermantess did not bore him but above all he was to go on at one of the clock in the morning with his wife to a great supper and costume ball with a view to which a costume of louis xi for himself and one of isabel of bavaria for his wife were waiting in readiness and the duke was determined not to be disturbed amid all these gaieties by the sufferings of the worthy amanien dosmond two other ladies carrying sticks mme de plassac and mme de tresmes both daughters of the comte de bréquigny came in next to pay basin a visit and declared that cousin mamas state left no room now for hope the duke shrugged his shoulders and to change the conversation asked whether they were going that evening to mariegilberts they replied that they were not in view of the state of amanien who was in his last agony and indeed they had excused themselves from the dinner to which the duke was going the other guests at which they proceeded to enumerate the brother of king theodosius the infanta maria concepcion and so forth as the marquis dosmond was less nearly related to them than he was to basin their defection appeared to the duke to be a sort of indirect reproach aimed at his own conduct and so albeit they had come down from the heights of the bréquigny mansion to see the duchess or rather to announce to her the alarming character incompatible for his relatives with attendance at social gatherings of their cousins illness they did not stay long and each armed with her alpenstock walpurge and dorothée such were the names of the two sisters retraced the craggy path to their citadel i never thought of asking the guermantes what was the meaning of these sticks so common in a certain part of the faubourg saintgermain possibly looking upon the whole parish as their domain and not caring to hire cabs they were in the habit of taking long walks for which some old fracture due to immoderate indulgence in the chase and to the falls from horseback which are often the fruit of that indulgence or simply rheumatism caused by the dampness of the left bank and of old country houses made a stick necessary perhaps they had not set out upon any such long expedition through the quarter but having merely come down into their garden which lay at no distance from that of the duchess to pick the fruit required for stewing had looked in on their way home to bid good evening to mme de guermantes though without going so far as to bring a pair of shears or a wateringcan into her house the duke appeared touched that i should have come to see them so soon after their return to paris but his face grew dark when i told him that i had come to ask his wife to find out whether her cousin really had invited me i had touched upon one of those services which m and mme de guermantes were not fond of rendering the duke explained to me that it was too late that if the princess had not sent me an invitation it would make him appear to be asking her for one that his cousins had refused him one once before and he had no wish to appear either directly or indirectly to be interfering with their visiting list be meddling finally he could not even be sure that he and his wife who were dining out that evening would not come straight home afterwards that in that case their best excuse for not having gone to the princesss party would be to conceal from her the fact of their return to paris instead of hastening to inform her of it as they must do if they sent her a note or spoke to her over the telephone about me and certainly too late to be of any use since in all probability the princesss list of guests would be closed by now you have not fallen foul of her in any way he asked in a suspicious tone the guermantes living in a constant fear of not being informed of the latest society quarrels and so of peoples trying to climb back into favour on their shoulders finally as the duke was in the habit of taking upon himself all decisions that might seem not very goodnatured listen my boy he said to me suddenly as though the idea had just come into his head i would really rather not mention at all to oriane that you have been speaking to me about it you know how kindhearted she is besides she has an enormous regard for you she would insist on sending to ask her cousin in spite of anything i might say to the contrary and if she is tired after dinner there will be no getting out of it she will be forced to go to the party no decidedly i shall say nothing to her about it anyhow you will see her yourself in a minute but not a word about that matter i beg of you if you decide to go to the party i have no need to tell you what a pleasure it will be to us to spend the evening there with you the motives actuating humanity are too sacred for him before whom they are invoked not to bow to them whether he believes them to be sincere or not i did not wish to appear to be weighing in the balance for a moment the relative importance of my invitation and the possible tiredness of mme de guermantes and i promised not to speak to her of the object of my visit exactly as though i had been taken in by the little farce which m de guermantes had performed for my benefit i asked him if he thought there was any chance of my seeing mme de stermaria at the princesss why no he replied with the air of an expert i know the name you mention from having seen it in lists of club members it is not at all the type of person who goes to gilberts you will see nobody there who is not excessively proper and intensely boring duchesses bearing titles which one thought were extinct years ago and which they have revived for the occasion all the ambassadors heaps of coburgs foreign royalties but you must not hope for the ghost of a stermaria gilbert would be taken ill at the mere thought of such a thing wait now you are fond of painting i must shew you a superb picture i bought from my cousin partly in exchange for the elstirs which frankly did not appeal to us it was sold to me as a philippe de champaigne but i believe myself that it is by some one even greater would you like to know my idea i believe it to be a velazquez and of the best period said the duke looking me boldly in the eyes whether to learn my impression or in the hope of enhancing it a footman came in mme la duchesse has told me to ask m le duc if m le duc will be so good as to see m swann as mme la duchesse is not quite ready shew m swann in said the duke after looking at his watch and seeing that he had still a few minutes before he need go to dress naturally my wife who told him to come is not ready there is no use saying anything before swann about mariegilberts party said the duke i do not know whether he is been invited gilbert likes him immensely because he believes him to be the natural grandson of the duc de berri but that is a long story otherwise you can imagine my cousin who falls in a fit if he sees a jew a mile off but now do not you see the dreyfus case has made things more serious swann ought to have realised that he more than anyone must drop all connexion with those fellows instead of which he says the most offensive things the duke called back the footman to know whether the man who had been sent to inquire at cousin osmonds had returned his plan was as follows as he believed and rightly that his cousin was dying he was anxious to obtain news of him before his death that is to say before he was obliged to go into mourning once covered by the official certainty that amanien was still alive he could go without a thought to his dinner to the princes party to the midnight revel at which he would appear as louis xi and had made the most exciting assignation with a new mistress and would make no more inquiries until the following day when his pleasures would be at an end then one would put on mourning if the cousin had passed away in the night no m le duc he is not back yet what in the name of god nothing is ever done in this house till the last minute cried the duke at the thought that amanien might still be in time to croak for an evening paper and so make him miss his revel he sent for the temps in which there was nothing i had not seen swann for a long time and asked myself at first whether in the old days he used to clip his moustache or had not his hair brushed up vertically in front for i found in him something altered it was simply that he was indeed greatly altered because he was very ill and illness produces in the face modifications as profound as are created by growing a beard or by changing the line of ones parting swanns illness was the same that had killed his mother who had been attacked by it at precisely the age which he had now reached our existences are in truth owing to heredity as full of cabalistic ciphers of horoscopic castings as if there really were sorcerers in the world and just as there is a certain duration of life for humanity in general so there is one for families in particular that is to say in any one family for the members of it who resemble one another swann was dressed with an elegance which like that of his wife associated with what he now was what he once had been buttoned up in a pearlgrey frockcoat which emphasised the tallness of his figure slender his white gloves stitched in black he carried a grey tall hat of a specially wide shape which delion had ceased now to make except for him the prince de sagan the marquis de modene m charles haas and comte louis de turenne i was surprised at the charming smile and affectionate handclasp with which he replied to my greeting for i had imagined that after so long an interval he would not recognise me at once i told him of my astonishment he received it with a shout of laughter a trace of indignation and a further grip of my hand as if it were throwing doubt on the soundness of his brain or the sincerity of his affection to suppose that he did not know me and yet that was what had happened he did not identify me as i learned long afterwards until several minutes later when he heard my name mentioned but no change in his face in his speech in the things he said to me betrayed the discovery which a chance word from m de guermantes had enabled him to make with such mastery with such absolute sureness did he play the social game he brought to it moreover that spontaneity in manners and personal initiative even in his style of dress which characterised the guermantes type thus it was that the greeting which the old clubman without recognising me had given me was not the cold and stiff greeting of the man of the world who was a pure formalist but a greeting full of a real friendliness of a true charm such as the duchesse de guermantes for instance possessed carrying it so far as to smile at you first before you had bowed to her if she met you in the street in contrast to the more mechanical greeting customary among the ladies of the faubourg saintgermain in the same way again the hat which in conformity with a custom that was beginning to disappear he laid on the floor by his feet was lined with green leather a thing not usually done because according to him this kept the hat much cleaner in reality because it was highly becoming now charles you are a great expert come and see what i have got to shew you after which my boys i am going to ask your permission to leave you together for a moment while i go and change my clothes besides i expect oriane will not be long now and he shewed his velazquez to swann but it seems to me that i know this said swann with the grimace of a sick man for whom the mere act of speaking requires an effort yes said the duke turned serious by the time which the expert took in expressing his admiration you have probably seen it at gilberts oh yes of course i remember what do you suppose it is oh well if it cornes from gilberts it is probably one of your ancestors said swann with a blend of irony and deference towards a form of greatness which he would have felt it impolite and absurd to despise but to which for reasons of good taste he preferred to make only a playful reference to be sure it is said the duke bluntly it is boson the i forget how manieth de guermantes not that i care a damn about that you know i am not as feudal as my cousin i have heard the names mentioned of rigaud mignard velazquez even he went on fastening on swann the gaze of an inquisitor and executioner in an attempt at once to read into his mind and to influence his response well he concluded for when he was led to provoke artificially an opinion which he desired to hear he had the faculty after a few moments of believing that it had been spontaneously uttered come now none of your flattery do you think it is by one of those big masters i have mentioned nnnnno said swann but after all i know nothing about these things it is not for me to decide who daubed the canvas but you are a dilettante a master of the subject to whom do you attribute it you are enough of an expert to have some idea what would you put it down as swann hesitated for a moment before the picture which obviously he thought atrocious a bad joke he replied with a smile at the duke who could not check an impulsive movement of rage when this had subsided be good fellows both of you wait a moment for oriane i must go and put on my swallowtails and then i will join you i shall send word to my good woman that you are both waiting for her i talked for a minute or two with swann about the dreyfus case and asked him how it was that all the guermantes were antidreyfusards in the first place because at heart all these people are antisemites replied swann who all the same knew very well from experience that certain of them were not but like everyone who supports any because with ardour preferred to explain the fact that other people did not share his opinion to suppose in them a preconceived reason a prejudice against which there was nothing to be done rather than reasons which might permit of discussion besides having come to the premature term of his life like a weary animal that is goaded on he cried out against these persecutions and was returning to the spiritual fold of his fathers yes the prince de guermantes i said it is true i have heard that he was antisemitic oh that fellow i was not even thinking about him he carries it to such a point that when he was in the army and had a frightful toothache he preferred to grin and bear it rather than go to the only dentist in the district who happened to be a jew and later on he allowed a wing of his castle which had caught fire to be burned to the ground because he would have had to send for extinguishers to the place next door which belongs to the rothschilds are you going to be there this evening by any chance yes swann replied although i am far too tired but he sent me a wire to tell me that he has something to say to me i feel that i shall be too unwell in the next few days to go there or to see him at home it would upset me so i prefer to get it over at once but the duc de guermantes is not antisemitic you can see quite well that he is since he is an antidreyfusard replied swann without noticing the logical fallacy that does not prevent my being very sorry that i disappointed the man what am i saying the duke i mean by not admiring his mignard or whatever he calls it but at any rate i went on reverting to the dreyfus case the duchess she now is intelligent yes she is charming to my mind however she was even more charming when she was still known as the princesse des laumes her mind has become somehow more angular it was all much softer in the juvenile great lady but after all young or old men or women what can you expect all these people belong to a different race one cannot have a thousand years of feudalism in ones blood with impunity naturally they imagine that it counts for nothing in their opinions all the same robert de saintloup is a dreyfusard ah so much the better all the more as you know that his mother is extremely and i had heard that he was but i was not certain of it that gives me a great deal of pleasure it does not surprise me he is highly intelligent it is a great thing that is dreyfusism had brought to swann an extraordinary simplicity of mind and had imparted to his way of looking at things an impulsiveness an inconsistency more noticeable even than had been the similar effects of his marriage to odette this new loss of caste would have been better described as a recasting and was entirely to his credit since it made him return to the ways in which his forebears had trodden and from which he had turned aside to mix with the aristocracy but swann just at the very moment when with such lucidity it had been granted to him thanks to the gifts he had inherited from his race to perceive a truth that was still hidden from people of fashion shewed himself nevertheless quite comically blind he subjected afresh all his admirations and all his contempts to the test of a new criterion dreyfusism that the antidreyfusism of mme bontemps should have made him think her a fool was no more astonishing than that when he was first married he should have thought her intelligent it was not very serious either that the new wave reached also his political judgments and made him lose all memory of having treated as a man with a price a british spy this latter was an absurdity of the guermantes set clemenceau whom he declared now to have always stood up for conscience to be a man of iron like comely no no i never told you anything of the sort you are thinking of some one else but sweeping past his political judgments the wave overthrew in swann his literary judgments also and even affected his way of pronouncing them barrés had lost all his talent and even the books of his early days were feeble one could hardly read them again you try you will find you cannot struggle to the end what a difference from clemenceau personally i am not anticlerical but when you compare them together you must see that barrés is invertebrate he is a very great fellow is old clemenceau how he knows the language however the antidreyfusards were in no position to criticise these follies they explained that one was a dreyfusard by ones being of jewish origin if a practising catholic like saniette stood out also for a fresh trial that was because he was buttonholed by mme verdurin who behaved like a wild radical she was out above all things against the frocks saniette was more fool than knave and had no idea of the harm that the mistress was doing him if you pointed out that brichot was equally a friend of mme verdurin and was a member of the patrie française that was because he was more intelligent you see him occasionally i asked swann referring to saintloup no never he wrote to me the other day hoping that i would ask the duc de mouchy and various other people to vote for him at the jockey where for that matter he got through like a letter through the post in spite of the case the question was never raised however i must tell you that since all this business began i never set foot in the place m de guermantes returned and was presently joined by his wife all ready now for the evening tall and proud in a gown of red satin the skirt of which was bordered with spangles she had in her hair a long ostrich feather dyed purple and over her shoulders a tulle scarf of the same red as her dress how nice it is to have ones hat lined with leather said the duchess whom nothing escaped however with you charles everything is always charming whether it is what you wear or what you say what you read or what you do swann meanwhile without apparently listening was considering the duchess as he would have studied the canvas of a master and then sought her gaze making with his lips the grimace which implies the devil mme de guermantes rippled with laughter so my clothes please you i am delighted but i must say that they do not please me much she went on with a sulking air good lord what a bore it is to have to dress up and go out when one would ever so much rather stay at home what magnificent rubies ah my dear charles at least one can see that you know what you are talking about you are not like that brute monserfeuil who asked me if they were real i must say that i have never seen anything quite like them they were a present from the grand duchess they are a little too large for my liking a little too like claret glasses filled to the brim but i have put them on because we shall be seeing the grand duchess this evening at mariegilberts added mme de guermantes never suspecting that this assertion destroyed the force of those previously made by the duke what is on at the princesss inquired swann practically nothing the duke hastened to reply the question having made him think that swann was not invited what is that basin when all the highways and hedgerows have been scoured it will be a deathly crush what will be pretty though she went on looking wistfully at swann if the storm i can feel in the air now does not break will be those marvellous gardens you know them of course i was there a month ago at the time when the lilacs were in flower you cannot have any idea how lovely they were and then the fountain really it is versailles in paris what sort of person is the princess i asked why you know quite well you have seen her here she is as beautiful as the day also rather an idiot very nice in spite of all her germanic highandmightiness full of good nature and stupid mistakes swann was too subtle not to perceive that the duchess in this speech was trying to shew the guermantes wit and at no great cost to herself for she was only serving up in a less perfect form an old saying of her own nevertheless to prove to the duchess that he appreciated her intention to be and as though she had really succeeded in being funny he smiled with a slightly forced air causing me by this particular form of insincerity the same feeling of awkwardness that used to disturb me long ago when i heard my parents discussing with m vinteuil the corruption of certain sections of society when they knew very well that a corruption far greater sat enthroned at montjouvain legrandin colouring his utterances for the benefit of fools choosing delicate epithets which he knew perfectly well would not be understood by a rich or smart but illiterate public come now oriane what on earth are you saying broke in m de guermantes marie a fool why she has read everything she is as musical as a fiddle but my poor little basin you are as innocent as a newborn babe as if one could not be all that and rather an idiot as well idiot is too strong a word no she is in the clouds she is hessedarmstadt holy roman empire and wawawa her pronunciation alone makes me tired but i quite admit that she is a charming loony simply the idea of stepping down from her german throne to go and marry in the most middleclass way a private citizen it is true that she chose him yes it is quite true she went on turning to me you do not know gilbert let me give you an idea of him he took to his bed once because i had left a card on mme carnot but my little charles said the duchess changing the conversation when she saw that the story of the card left on the carnots appeared to irritate m de guermantes you know you have never sent me that photograph of our knights of rhodes whom i have learned to love through you and i am so anxious to make their acquaintance the duke meanwhile had not taken his eyes from his wifes face oriane you might at least tell the story properly and not cut out half i ought to explain he corrected addressing swann that the british ambassadress at that time who was a very worthy woman but lived rather in the moon and was in the habit of making up these odd combinations conceived the distinctly quaint idea of inviting us with the president and his wife we were oriane herself was rather surprised especially as the ambassadress knew quite enough of the people we knew not to invite us of all things to so illassorted a gathering there was a minister there who is a swindler however i pass over all that we had not been warned in time were caught in the trap and i am bound to admit all these people behaved most civilly to us only once was enough mme de guermantes who does not often do me the honour of consulting me felt it incumbent upon her to leave a card in the course of the following week at the elysée gilbert may perhaps have gone rather far in regarding it as a stain upon our name but it must not be forgotten that politics apart m carnot who for that matter filled his post quite adequately was the grandson of a member of the revolutionary tribunal which caused the death of eleven of our people in a single day in that case basin why did you go every week to dine at chantilly the due daumale was just as much the grandson of a member of the revolutionary tribunal with this difference that carnot was a brave man and philippe egalité a wretched scoundrel excuse my interrupting you to explain that i did send the photograph said swann i cannot understand how it has not reached you it does not altogether surprise me said the duchess my servants tell me only what they think fit they probably do not approve of the order of saint john and she rang the bell you know oriane that when i used to go to chantilly it was without enthusiasm without enthusiasm but with a nightshirt in a bag in case the prince asked you to stay which for that matter he very rarely did being a perfect cad like all the orléans lot do you know who else are to be dining at mme de sainteuvertes mme de guermantes asked her husband besides the people you know already she is asked at the last moment king theodosiuss brother at these tidings the duchesss features breathed contentment and her speech boredom oh good heavens more princes but that one is wellmannered and intelligent swann suggested not altogether though replied the duchess apparently seeking for words that would give more novelty to the thought expressed have you ever noticed with princes that the bestmannered among them are not really wellmannered they must always have an opinion about everything then as they have none of their own they spend the first half of their lives asking us ours and the other half serving it up to us secondhand they positively must be able to say that one piece has been well played and the next not so well when there is no difference listen this little theodosius junior i forget his name asked me what one called an orchestral motif i replied said the duchess her eyes sparkling while a laugh broke from her beautiful red lips one calls it an orchestral motif i do not think he was any too well pleased really oh my dear charles she went on what a bore it can be dining out there are evenings when one would sooner die it is true that dying may be perhaps just as great a bore because we do not know what it is like a servant appeared it was the young lover who used to have trouble with the porter until the duchess in her kindness of heart brought about an apparent peace between them am i to go up this evening to inquire for m le marquis dosmond he asked most certainly not nothing before tomorrow morning in fact i do not want you to remain in the house tonight the only thing that will happen will be that his footman who knows you will come to you with the latest report and send you out after us get off go anywhere you like have a woman sleep out but i do not want to see you here before tomorrow morning an immense joy overflowed from the footmans face he would at last be able to spend long hours with his ladylove whom he had practically ceased to see ever since after a final scene with the porter the duchess had considerately explained to him that it would be better to avoid further conflicts if he did not go out at all he floated at the thought of having an evening free at last in a happiness which the duchess saw and guessed its reason she felt so to speak a tightening of the heart and an itching in all her limbs at the sight of this happiness which an amorous couple were snatching behind her back concealing themselves from her which left her irritated and jealous no basin let him stay here i say he is not to stir out of the house but oriane that is absurd the house is crammed with servants and you have the costumiers people coming as well at twelve to dress us for this show there is absolutely nothing for him to do and he is the only one who is a friend of mamas footman i would a thousand times rather get him right away from the house listen basin let me do what i want i shall have a message for him to take in the evening as it happens i cannot tell yet at what time in any case you are not to go out of the house for a single instant do you hear she said to the despairing footman if there were continual quarrels and if servants did not stay long with the duchess the person to whose charge this guerrilla warfare was to be laid was indeed irremovable but it was not the porter no doubt for the rougher tasks for the martyrdoms that it was more tiring to inflict for the quarrels which ended in blows the duchess entrusted the heavier instruments to him but even then he played his part without the least suspicion that he had been cast for it like the household servants he admired the duchess for her kindness of heart and footmen of little discernment who came back after leaving her service to visit françoise used to say that the dukes house would have been the finest place in paris if it had not been for the porters lodge the duchess played the lodge on them just as at different times clericalism freemasonry the jewish peril have been played on the public another footman came into the room why have not they brought up the package that m swann sent here and by the way you have heard charles that mama is seriously ill jules went up to inquire for news of m le marquis dosmond has he come back yet he is just come this instant m le duc they are waiting from one moment to the next for m le marquis to pass away ah he is alive exclaimed the duke with a sigh of relief that is all right that is all right sold again satan while there is life there is hope the duke announced to us with a joyful air they have been talking about him as though he were dead and buried in a week from now he will be fitter than i am it is the doctors who said that he would not last out the evening one of them wanted to call again during the night the head one said it was no use m le marquis would be dead by then they have only kept him alive by injecting him with camphorated oil hold your tongue you damned fool cried the duke in a paroxysm of rage who the devil asked you to say all that you have not understood a word of what they told you it was not me they told it was jules will you hold your tongue roared the duke and turning to swann what a blessing he is still alive he will regain his strength gradually do not you know still alive after being in such a critical state that in itself is an excellent sign one must not expect everything at once it cannot be at all unpleasant a little injection of camphorated oil he rubbed his hands he is alive what more could anyone want after going through all that he is gone through it is a great step forward upon my word i envy him having such a temperament ah these invalids you know people do all sorts of little things for them that they do not do for us now today there was a devil of a cook who sent me up a leg of mutton with béarnaise sauce it was done to a turn i must admit but just for that very reason i took so much of it that it is still lying on my stomach however that does not make people come to inquire for me as they do for dear amanien we do too much inquiring it only tires him we must let him have room to breathe they are killing the poor fellow by sending round to him all the time well said the duchess to the footman as he was leaving the room i gave orders for the envelope containing a photograph which m swann sent me to be brought up here madame la duchesse it is so large that i did not know if i could get it through the door we have left it in the hall does madame la duchesse wish me to bring it up oh in that case no they ought to have told me but if it is so big i shall see it in a moment when i come downstairs i forgot to tell mme la duchesse that mme la comtesse mole left a card this morning for mme la duchesse what this morning said the duchess with an air of disapproval feeling that so young a woman ought not to take the liberty of leaving cards in the morning about ten of the clock madame la duchesse shew me the cards in any case oriane when you say that it was a funny idea on maries part to marry gilbert went on the duke reverting to the original topic of conversation it is you who have an odd way of writing history if either of them was a fool it was gilbert for having married of all people a woman so closely related to the king of the belgians who has usurped the name of brabant which belongs to us to put it briefly we are of the same blood as the hesses and of the elder branch it is always stupid to talk about oneself he apologised to me but after all whenever we have been not only at darmstadt but even at cassel and all over electoral hesse the landgraves have always all of them been most courteous in giving us precedence as being of the elder branch but really basin you do not mean to tell me that a person who was a major in every regiment in her country who had been engaged to the king of sweden oriane that is too much anyone would think that you did not know that the king of swedens grandfather was tilling the soil at pau when we had been ruling the roost for nine hundred years throughout the whole of europe that does not alter the fact that if somebody were to say in the street hallo there is the king of sweden everyone would at once rush to see him as far as the place de la concorde and if he said there is m de guermantes nobody would know who m de guermantes was what an argument besides i never can understand how once the title of duke of brabant has passed to the belgian royal family you can continue to claim it the footman returned with the comtesse moles card or rather what she had left in place of a card alleging that she had none on her she had taken from her pocket a letter addressed to herself and keeping the contents had handed in the envelope which bore the inscription la comtesse mole as the envelope was rather large following the fashion in notepaper which prevailed that year this manuscript card was almost twice the size of an ordinary visiting card that is what people call mme moles simplicity said the duchess ironically she wants to make us think that she had no cards on her and to shew her originality but we know all about that do not we my little charles we are quite old enough and quite original enough ourselves to see through the tricks of a little lady who has only been going about for four years she is charming but she does not seem to me all the same to be quite big enough to imagine that she can take the world by surprise with so little effort as merely leaving an envelope instead of a card and leaving it at ten of the clock in the morning her old mother mouse will shew her that she knows a thing or two about that swann could not help smiling at the thought that the duchess who was incidentally a trifle jealous of mme moles success would find it quite in accordance with the guermantes wit to make some impertinent retort to her visitor so far as the title of duc de brabant is concerned i have told you a hundred times oriane the duke continued but the duchess without listening cut him short but my little charles i am longing to see your photograph ah extinctor draconis latrator anubis said swann yes it was so charming what you said about that when you were comparing the saint george at venice but i do not understand why anubis what is the one like who was an ancestor of babal asked m de guermantes you want to see his bauble retorted his wife dryly to shew she herself scorned the pun i want to see them all she added listen charles let us wait downstairs till the carriage comes said the duke you can pay your call on us in the hall because my wife will not let us have any peace until she is seen your photograph i am less impatient i must say he added with a satisfied air i am not easily moved myself but she would see us all dead rather than miss it i am entirely of your opinion basin said the duchess let us go into the hall we shall at least know why we have come down from your study while we shall never know how we have come down from the counts of brabant i have told you a hundred times how the title came into the house of hesse said the duke while we were going downstairs to look at the photograph and i thought of those that swann used to bring me at combray through the marriage of a brabant in with the daughter of the last landgrave of thuringia and hesse so that really it is the title of prince of hesse that came to the house of brabant rather than that of duke of brabant to the house of hesse you will remember that our battlecry was that of the dukes of brabant limbourg to her conqueror until we exchanged the arms of brabant for those of guermantes in which i think myself that we were wrong and the example of the gramonts will not make me change my opinion but replied mme de guermantes as it is the king of the belgians who is the conqueror besides the belgian crown prince calls himself duc de brabant but my dear child your argument will not hold water for a moment you know as well as i do that there are titles of pretension which can perfectly well exist even if the territory is occupied by usurpers for instance the king of spain describes himself equally as duke of brabant claiming in virtue of a possession less ancient than ours but more ancient than that of the king of the belgians he calls himself also duke of burgundy king of the indies occidental and oriental and duke of milan well he is no more in possession of burgundy the indies or brabant than i possess brabant myself or the prince of hesse either for that matter the king of spain likewise proclaims himself king of jerusalem as does the austrian emperor and jerusalem belongs to neither one nor the other he stopped for a moment with an awkward feeling that the mention of jerusalem might have embarrassed swann in view of current events but only went on more rapidly what you said just now might be said of anyone we were at one time dukes of aumale a duchy that has passed as regularly to the house of france as joinville and chevreuse have to the house of albert we make no more claim to those titles than to that of marquis de noirmoutiers which was at one time ours and became perfectly regularly the appanage of the house of la trémoille but because certain cessions are valid it does not follow that they all are for instance he went on turning to me my sisterinlaws son bears the title of prince dagrigente which comes to us from joan the mad as that of prince de tarente comes to the la trémoilles well napoleon went and gave this title of tarente to a soldier who may have been admirable in the ranks but in doing so the emperor was disposing of what belonged to him even less than napoleon iii when he created a duc de montmorency since périgord had at least a mother who was a montmorency while the tarente of napoleon i had no more tarente about him than napoleons wish that he should become so that did not prevent chaix destange alluding to our uncle condé from asking the procurer impérial if he had picked up the title of duc de montmorency in the moat of vincennes listen basin i ask for nothing better than to follow you to the ditches of vincennes or even to tarante and that reminds me charles of what i was going to say to you when you were telling me about your saint george at venice we have an idea basin and i of spending next spring in italy and sicily if you were to come with us just think what a difference it would make i am not thinking only of the pleasure of seeing you but imagine after all you have told me so often about the remains of the norman conquest and of ancient history imagine what a trip like that would become if you came with us i mean to say that even basin what am i saying gilbert would benefit by it because i feel that even his claims to the throne of naples and all that sort of thing would interest me if they were explained by you in old romanesque churches in little villages perched on hills like primitive paintings but now we are going to look at your photograph open the envelope said the duchess to a footman please oriane not this evening you can look at it tomorrow implored the duke who had already been making signs of alarm to me on seeing the huge size of the photograph but i like to look at it with charles said the duchess with a smile at once artificially concupiscent and psychologically subtle for in her desire to be friendly to swann she spoke of the pleasure which she would have in looking at the photograph as though it were the pleasure an invalid feels he would find in eating an orange or as though she had managed to combine an escapade with her friends with giving information to a biographer as to some of her favourite pursuits all right he will come again to see you on purpose declared the duke to whom his wife was obliged to yield you can spend three hours in front of it if that amuses you he added ironically but where are you going to stick a toy of those dimensions why in my room of course i like to have it before my eyes oh just as you please if it is in your room probably i shall never see it said the duke without thinking of the revelation he was thus blindly making of the negative character of his conjugal relations very well you will undo it with the greatest care mme de guermantes told the servant multiplying her instructions out of politeness to swann and see that you do not crumple the envelope either so even the envelope has got to be respected the duke murmured to me raising his eyes to the ceiling but swann he added i who am only a poor married man and thoroughly prosaic what i wonder at is how on earth you managed to find an envelope that size where did you pick it up oh at the photographers they are always sending out things like that but the man is a fool for i see he is written on it the duchesse de guermantes without putting madame i will forgive him for that said the duchess carelessly then seeming to be struck by a sudden idea which enlivened her checked a faint smile but at once returning to swann well you do not say whether you are coming to italy with us madame i am really afraid that it will not be possible indeed mme de montmorency is more fortunate you went with her to venice and vicenza she told me that with you one saw things one would never see otherwise things no one had ever thought of mentioning before that you shewed her things she had never dreamed of and that even in the wellknown things she had been able to appreciate details which without you she might have passed by a dozen times without ever noticing obviously she has been more highly favoured than we are to be you will take the big envelope from m swanns photograph she said to the servant and you will hand it in from me this evening at half past ten at mme la comtesse moles swann laughed i should like to know all the same mme de guermantes asked him how ten months before the time you can tell that a thing will be impossible my dear duchess i will tell you if you insist upon it but first of all you can see that i am very ill yes my little charles i do not think you look at all well i am not pleased with your colour but i am not asking you to come with me next week i ask you to come in ten months in ten months one has time to get oneself cured you know at this point a footman came in to say that the carriage was at the door come oriane to horse said the duke already pawing the ground with impatience as though he were himself one of the horses that stood waiting outside very well give me in one word the reason why you cannot come to italy the duchess put it to swann as she rose to say goodbye to us but my dear friend it is because i shall then have been dead for several months according to the doctors i consulted last winter the thing i have got which may for that matter carry me off at any moment will not in any case leave me more than three or four months to live and even that is a generous estimate replied swann with a smile while the footman opened the glazed door of the hall to let the duchess out what is that you say cried the duchess stopping for a moment on her way to the carriage and raising her fine eyes their melancholy blue clouded by uncertainty placed for the first time in her life between two duties as incompatible as getting into her carriage to go out to dinner and shewing pity for a man who was about to die she could find nothing in the code of conventions that indicated the right line to follow and not knowing which to choose felt it better to make a show of not believing that the latter alternative need be seriously considered so as to follow the first which demanded of her at the moment less effort and thought that the best way of settling the conflict would be to deny that any existed you are joking she said to swann it would be a joke in charming taste replied he ironically i do not know why i am telling you this i have never said a word to you before about my illness but as you asked me and as now i may die at any moment but whatever i do i must not make you late you are dining out remember he added because he knew that for other people their own social obligations took precedence of the death of a friend and could put himself in her place by dint of his instinctive politeness but that of the duchess enabled her also to perceive in a vague way that the dinner to which she was going must count for less to swann than his own death and so while continuing on her way towards the carriage she let her shoulders droop saying do not worry about our dinner it is not of any importance but this put the duke in a bad humour who exclaimed come oriane do not stop there chattering like that and exchanging your jeremiads with swann you know very well that mme de sainteuverte insists on sitting down to table at eight of the clock sharp we must know what you propose to do the horses have been waiting for a good five minutes i beg your pardon charles he went on turning to swann but it is ten minutes to eight already oriane is always late and it will take us more than five minutes to get to old sainteuvertes mme de guermantes advanced resolutely towards the carriage and uttered a last farewell to swann you know we can talk about that another time i do not believe a word you have been saying but we must discuss it quietly i expect they gave you a dreadful fright come to luncheon whatever day you like with mme de guermantes things always resolved themselves into luncheons you will let me know your day and time and lifting her red skirt she set her foot on the step she was just getting into the carriage when seeing this foot exposed the duke cried in a terrifying voice oriane what have you been thinking of you wretch you have kept on your black shoes with a red dress go upstairs quick and put on red shoes or rather he said to the footman tell the ladys maid at once to bring down a pair of red shoes but my dear replied the duchess gently annoyed to see that swann who was leaving the house with me but had stood back to allow the carriage to pass out in front of us could hear since we are late no no we have plenty of time it is only ten to it will not take us ten minutes to get to the parc monceau and after all what would it matter if we turned up at half past eight they would have to wait for us but you cannot possibly go there in a red dress and black shoes besides we shall not be the last i can tell you the sassenages are coming and you know they never arrive before twenty to nine the duchess went up to her room well said m de guermantes to swann and myself we poor downtrodden husbands people laugh at us but we are of some use all the same but for me oriane would have been going out to dinner in black shoes it is not unbecoming said swann i noticed the black shoes and they did not offend me in the least i do not say you are wrong replied the duke but it looks better to have them to match the dress besides you need not worry she would no sooner have got there than she would have noticed them and i should have been obliged to come home and fetch the others i should have had my dinner at nine of the clock goodbye my children he said thrusting us gently from the door get away before oriane comes down again it is not that she does not like seeing you both on the contrary she is too fond of your company if she finds you still here she will start talking again she is tired out already she will reach the dinnertable quite dead besides i tell you frankly i am dying of hunger i had a wretched luncheon this morning when i came from the train there was the devil of a béarnaise sauce i admit but in spite of that i shall not be at all sorry not at all sorry to sit down to dinner five minutes to eight oh women women she will give us both indigestion before tomorrow she is not nearly as strong as people think the duke felt no compunction at speaking thus of his wifes ailments and his own to a dying man for the former interested him more appeared to him more important and so it was simply from good breeding and good fellowship that after politely shewing us out he cried from off stage in a stentorian voice from the porch to swann who was already in the courtyard you now do not let yourself be taken in by the doctors nonsense damn them they are donkeys you are as strong as the pont neuf you will live to bury us allembed

rock,in the plus years since their formation iron maiden have served as the embodiment of all that defines heavy metal in this fanvalidated genre they have done everything on their own terms even back in their earliest days where they refused to conform to punk standards in order to secure a record deal the unwavering steve harris had a vision compromising nothing except maybe for the tempo of flight of icarus as iron maidens timeless songs and mythical stage productions won fans over worldwide with little help from the mainstream so many of their peers thrived on boasting in our estimation the strongest catalog in metal ranking every song from eddie and the boys was a daunting but welcome challenge each song a storybook of sorts iron maiden have taken their listeners through the wartorn skies where fighter pilots clashed in world war ii ushered the condemned on the lonely walk to the gallows traveled back to ancient egypt where men became gods not a far cry from their immortal heavy metal status and through other historic moments and realms of fantastic escape through literature and film even in the st century iron maidens output has contested their stunning seven album streak in the s not content to resign themselves to being a greatest hits band they have alternated album tours with nods to specific eras in their past demonstrating the staying power of their entire catalog even resurrecting two classics from the divisive blaze bayley era on their legacy of the beast tour no other band has maintained such a level of dominance for so long a notion that becomes soberingly evident as you scroll through our ranking of iron maidens songs below with dozens of fanfavorites appearing well beyond the mark up the irons today tomorrow and for all eternity even if eternity should fail every iron maiden song ranked from worst to best scroll through the gallery to see how we ranked every song iron maiden have written the angel and the gambler virtual xi the blaze bayley era of iron maiden coincided with a massive downturn in the acceptance of s heavy metal the band was clearly struggling and the angel and the gambler is the biggest miss of their career from the chintzy baba oreilly ripoff to the cartoon soundboard orchestration to the painstakingly repetitive that goes on for three minutes more than it should have now onto better things weekend warrior fear of the dark if there is one thing we did not want iron maiden to write a song about it was football they call it football we call it soccer okay football hooliganism in this case but weekend warrior was still a lyrical square peg in a heavy metal world full of dragon andor spaceshipshaped holes just so you know dl i live my way the x factor only available on the inch vinyl version of the man on the edge single i live my way probably wins an award for being one of the most obscure maiden songs sadly it is not one of the most memorable dl burning ambition running free single easily the worst song maiden recorded with paul dianno it does not fit in with the rest of the output from that era had they continued down this road they would be little more than a mainstream leaning hard rock band it makes an interesting bside to running free but we are glad it did not make the cut for the bands flawless selftitled debut bi nodding donkey blues fear of the dark iron maiden never were a blues band but they definitely know how to have fun with the genre this bside to be quick or be dead is a prime example let us just say that this song is kind of their tongueincheek version of whole lotta rosie bonus a boogiewoogie piano solo during which bruce deadpans there should be some kind of guitar solo here bi quest for fire piece of mind welcome to the worst iron maiden song of the s films have provided maiden with rich lyrical inspiration but on quest for fire they tread in the shallowest of waters nicking the film of the same name which was adapted from the book of the same name for a source material it is a hamfisted attempt to write about early mans discovery of fire and the subsequent pursuit for those precious embers but it comes across as a drunken studio romp rife with hokey riffing and bottomfeeding lyrics for all the classics harris gave us he is earned at least one pass he is lucky the trooper is also on piece of mind jd como estais amigos virtual xi it turned out to be blaze bayleys swan song but como estasis amigos was one of the few songs on virtual xi that really put his voice to good use unfortunately the albums thin sonics and fatal lack of urgency made this a less emotional finale than it could have been dl black bart blues can i play with madness single the bside to can i play with madness could have been called ok now i am playing with madness it is easy to imagine that after working on the heavy and proggy seventh son of a seventh son maiden wanted to have some lighthearted fun this van halenlike jam definitely is fun and also pretty bonkers the lyrics are about black bart allegedly a suit of armor that the band picked up on their adventures somehow bart meets a woman with a mysterious background do not know where she is beenmaybe she is an acrobatspends her evenings dancing on a pole if that is not weird enough bruce dickinson argues with a high pitched character during the song and just when you think that the song is finished nicko mcbrain takes over and screws around for about two more minutes it is too weird to describe but you can find the track on youtube and check it out bi the apparition fear of the dark one of those songs that probably seemed like a good idea at the time the apparition brought a staccato funk vibe to the maiden table something like that anyway the instrumental and solo sections are great but the s verge on a confused mess dl virus best of the beast as if the xfactor was not grim and harrowing enough the standalone single that followed it took maiden into even more hopeless anguished territory blaze bayley does his best to keep the whole thing cracking along but it is essentially a monochrome dirge with no real tune dl no prayer for the dying no prayer for the dying easily the weakest album the band have made with bruce on board no prayer for the dying was sold to fans as a backtobasics affair the reality was that much of it sounded unimaginative and halfbaked the title track while eminently likable is almost certainly not on your maiden spotify playlist dl do not look to the eyes of a stranger virtual xi needlessly drawn out and powered by some rather pedestrian riffs that surely would not have made the grade on earlier maiden albums do not look to the eyes of a stranger stumbles on its own complexity and has an ending that does not work dl roll over vic vella fear of the dark a semicover of chuck berrys roll over beethoven with new lyrics about the bands roadie vic vella chuck berry covers unsurprisingly are not iron maidens strong suit on the other hand it is better than judas priests johnny b goode bi hooks in you no prayer for the dying adrian smith has written so many songs that are vastly better than hooks in you that it seems a bit pointless to mention it at all but we must if only to celebrate the phrase new ideas for the décor tonight never thought we would hear bruce sing that to be fair dl wasting love fear of the dark a wellintended but unsatisfying ballad on fear of the dark an album that had plenty of much more exciting moments wasting love is both an overlong showcase for bruce dickinsons voice and a good excuse to go and make some tea dl the educated fool virtual xi stymied by its anaemic production and a palpable lack of killer material virtual xi is not without its merits and the educated fool boasts at least one great melody to justify its inclusion compared to the clansman however it is not up to scratch dl tears of a clown the book of souls briefly played during maidens book of souls live campaign this selfexplanatory salute to troubled funny men is yet another great example of adrian smiths subtly subversive contributions to the maiden sound but a smokey robinson cover would have been much funnier if we are honest dl el dorado the final frontier it starts with what sounds like an ending a typically contrary maiden move let us face it el dorado is not one of the bands greatest singles but it did win a grammy for best metal performance in so hooray for that dl out of the shadows a matter of life and death brimming with moments of unashamed prog abandon this oddity gave a matter of life and death one of its rare moments of emotional respite albeit mainly because steve harris bassline is so goddamn hypnotic dl fortunes of war the x factor after a relatively exciting opening triumvirate of new songs the xfactor slows down for fortunes of war and loses practically all of its momentum the lyrics are brooding and full of quiet rage but the music beneath them is not among maidens finest five minutes dl the aftermath the x factor the lumbering nadir of the xfactor the aftermath arrives after fortunes of war and look for the truth have already drained your lifesblood the longest darkest and least memorable of the three it does at least hammer home the point that steve harris was in a terrible mood dl mother russia no prayer for the dying by maiden fans were used to the bands albums containing a grandiose epic or two but after the glories of rime of the ancient mariner and seventh son of a seventh son mother russia was a slight anticlimax you can bet dimmu borgir liked it though dl childhoods end fear of the dark there are more than a few unsung gems lurking on maidens less celebrated albums and the skewed gothprog splendour of childhoods end is firmly among them by no means a classic it does give fear of the dark a rare moment of forwardthinking oomph dl look for the truth the x factor the big downfall of the xfactor is the prolonged period of slow miserable songs halfway through look for the truth is particularly weak with predictable chord changes serving only to hammer home the lack of a genuinely punchy melody dl listen with nicko part xi no prayer for the dying nicko mcbrain he is just ahead of his time he was a podcaster decades before podcasts or even ipods on s the first ten years box set he recorded a bunch of monologues as bonus tracks they were so popular or at least someone told nicko that they were that he recorded another one as a bonus track for no prayer for the dying note to nicko the world needs to know about your comedic brilliance seriously please start a podcast bi age of innocence dance of death age of innocence finds iron maiden returning to the well of film and literature to vent their frustrations with the world and its rocky systems of government the vitriol here is fairly shallow though echoing the same tired sentiments of countless citizens of the world and while yes its certainly angsty with some aggressive riffing it is not very inspired jd the man who would be king the final frontier with dave murrays ultramelodic instincts all over it the penultimate epic from the final frontier veers from swooshing keys and a disembodied bruce floating in the haze to long stretches of fullon maiden bombast replete with what sound like postin flames harmonies that is a joke for our older readers by the way dl for the greater good of god a matter of life and death steve harris loves a good epic he also loves a heartwrenching war story this nineminute sprawl from a matter of life and death combines the two to chilling and faintly morose effect resurrected for the current legacy of the beast tour it is not a party banger dl am the x factor one slow sad song too many for most fans when they reached the end of maidens most emotionally gruelling album am works best in isolation a pretty but spiky ballad beautifully sung by blaze it is a straightforward outpouring of melancholy and angst dl mission from arry minutes to midnight single although bruce dickinson does not appear on this recording we have him to thank for it mission from arry is a recording of a pretty intense but funny argument between steve harris aka arry and nicko mcbrain that bruce was kind enough to record for the rest of us it reached the public as a bside to minutes to midnight apparently during a gig steve harris bass gear broke down and he sent a roadie to tell mcbrain to extend his drum solo while they were fixing it the moral of the story is do not interrupt a drummer during the solo but if you do be sure to record the ensuing brawl bi the pilgrim a matter of life and death arguably the runt of the a matter of life and death litter the pilgrim is an essential part of the album but not a song you are likely to whistle in the shower fastpaced and edgy it is every bit as progressive as the songs around it but lacks one truly heartstopping moment dl dance of death dance of death lauded and loathed in equal measure for being a little bit too close to spinal taps stonehenge routine for comfort dance of death wears its prog rock influences with pride and really does not care if you like songs about wizards or not so there dl deja vu somewhere in time one of the fastest tracks on somewhere in time déja vu is much loved by maiden fans of a certain age partly because it is a rare dave murraysteve harris cowrite we nerds love this shit and partly because the twinlead moments are spectacular the lyrics are a bit daft however dl chains of misery fear of the dark uncomfortably close to the kind of onedimensional metal that maiden had always avoided chains of misery is unusual for the bands decision to use gang vocals in the worth a try perhaps but it does not really work this is more filler than killer dl judgement of heaven the x factor a song that just about saves the xfactor from falling asleep at the wheel judgement of heaven has a killer that is sadly not quite matched by the rest of the tune a great vocal from blaze bayley however and a wistfully quasispiritual lyric thrown in for free dl when the rivers runs deep the book of souls a strong candidate for the weakest track on the book of souls when the river runs deep just about earns its place on maidens latest album thanks to a brilliantly offthewall adrian smith solo four minutes in dl sheriff of huddersfield somewhere in time maidens best bsides have generally been spirited covers or very occasionally the sound of grown men dicking about a tribute to manager rod smallwood that pulls no punches about the great mans reported miserliness it is actually a halfdecent song with stupid lyrics dl the reincarnation of benjamin breeg a matter of life and death the first song to be released from a matter of life and death this dark heavy and seemingly unlikely single arrived tied to some vague promotional scheme involving a the mysterious identity of the songs titular hero no we do not know how that worked out either dl journeyman dance of death maidens muchvaunted leap into acoustic territory was one of dance of deaths most memorable moments with a vague hint of jethro tull and a large dollop of worldweary resignation journeyman worked pretty well live too dl the loneliness of the long distance runner somewhere in time another steve harris composition reportedly inspired by his voracious moviewatching habits this rapacious epic may pale beside the better songs on somewhere in time but it is still a riot of spiralling leads and lithe rhythmic wallop dl lord of the flies the x factor it is never been that hard to keep track of steve harris reading and watching habits this songs thematic debt to william goldings legendary novel was fully in keeping with the dark aesthetic of the xfactor but maiden have seldom sounded less chirpy dl holy smoke no prayer for the dying belatedly addressing the tv preacher phenomenon with no great subtlety holy smoke is not one of maidens best singles but it is notable for boasting a a rare sighting of a curse word in a maiden song bruce says shit and b one of the bestworst videos ever made dl satellite the final frontier the final frontier opinion was split on the values of satellite a noisy futuristic intro with jarring programmed drums and it still sounds like what it was an adrian smith demo but the final frontier is a nutsout skypunching maiden anthem so it is not all bad news dl justice of the peace the x factor a murrayharris cowrite confined to the bside on the second of two cd single versions of man on the edge it was a confusing time to be alive folks this fairtomiddling rabblerouser is arguably more exciting than a good third of the xfactor just saying dl fates warning no prayer for the dying literally no ones favourite maiden song fates warning was probably not named after the iconic progressive metal band not least because it lacks a single interesting musical idea a major low point in the first bruce era you just cannot whistle it in the shower can you dl the mercenary brave new world on an album full of joyful demonstrations of their renewed prowess iron maiden could probably have left the mercenary off brave new world simply because it is the kind of song you suspect they can write in their collective sleep dl the unbeliever the x factor tucked at the backend of somewhat overlong the xfactor the unbeliever may be a song that many fans never quite got round to listening to but they should it is a scowling nihilistic affair with some neat proggy touches dl death or glory the book of souls custom built for live performance death or glory saw adrian smith reasserting himself as master of brevity and bombast bruce dickinsons instruction to climb like a monkey never made a great deal of sense but this is heavy metal not chemistry dl afraid to shoot strangers fear of the dark perhaps against the odds this rambling epic has made occasional visits to maidens set lists over the last years it is a tense and turbulent war story the horrors of the gulf war brought eloquently to life by steve harris dl invaders the number of the beast few would argue that invaders is a classic like run to the hills or the number of the beast but it is hard to imagine maidens triumphant breakthrough album without this madeyed riffdriven ambush as its starting point new frontier dance of death three decades after joining iron maiden nicko mcbrain earned his first writing credit on the frankensteininspired new frontier the tracks kicking energy and singleleaning approach is the last bit of joy to be found as darkness looms large over the ensuing four tracks that close out the dance of death record despite its charm it does not have as much staying power on the dynamic recording but it is always a fun one when it pops up either on shuffle or when cruising through dance of death jd man on the edge the x factor the first blaze bayleyfronted maiden song to be released man on the edge came as a great relief to many diehards spiky and aggressive its reimagining of michael douglas peerless film falling down gave the xfactor some much needed energy dl from here to eternity fear of the dark a disappointingly prosaic rock and roller from the intermittently great fear of the dark this mostly unloved single always seemed a bit unimaginative especially since only four years had passed since seventh son of a seventh son dl these colours do not run a matter of life and death sharon osbourne may deserve a songwriting credit on these colours do not run since the track would not exist without her egging of iron maiden at ozzfest named after the sentiment bruce dickinson aired onstage these colours do not run is another solid wartime effort from maiden worthy of its seven minute run time gh the edge of darkness the x factor one of several moody predominantly slowpaced epics that steve harris wrote to showcase blaze bayleys powerful gritty voice this was a highlight of the underrated second half of the xfactor albeit not one you would necessarily play at a party dl wildest dreams dance of death maiden went through a period where every new album seemed to be preceded by a short snappy threetofourminute singalong single wildest dreams is not one of the bands best but it served its purpose perfectly well as a set opener on the dance of death tour dl invasion the soundhouse tapes blustery and naive it may be but invasion is an exciting snapshot of early maiden when harnessing the energy of punk at least seemed to be part of the bands modus operandi revered for its presence on the soundhouse tapes alone it is basically impossible to dislike dl the fallen angel brave new world there is nothing wrong with the fallen angel it is a sturdy maiden anthem with some great riffs and a huge it is just nowhere near as lifeaffirming as the wicker man or other classics from brave new world so there is that dl the assassin no prayer for the dying one of the most adventurous and distinctive songs on no prayer for the dying the assassin was a little out of place on an otherwise disappointingly straightforward album worth a second glance it offers faint clues to maidens eventual rebirth as prog metal overlords dl gates of tomorrow dance of death a decent showcase for the occasional harrisdickinsongers teamup gates of tomorrow is a nononsense stormer that was perhaps too firmly rooted in trad maiden territory to stand out amid the gently eclectic menu offered up by dance of death dl the man of sorrows the book of souls all glory to mr dave murray on this one the guitarists legato technique is flawless and unparalleled as notes elegantly blossom from his smooth overtlymelodic delivery he sets the mood on the man of sorrows not to be confused with bruces accident of birth solo track man of sorrows with his fluttering lead work and the song quickly takes on a theme of hope enveloped in uncertainty with striding rhythms bombastic synths and melancholic melodies jd face in the sand dance of death dance of death was a strange combination of classic maidenisms and unexpected leftturns face in the sand takes an age to get going but its floydesque slowbuild suits the darker intent of mature maiden perfectly extra points for nickos thudding doublekicks dl the fugitive fear of the dark a song that promises much but delivers slightly less the fugitive is a classic steve harris anthem straightahead riffs and linear lyrics with a bonus detour into moderately proggy territory for the songs actually rather brilliant instrumental midsection dl when two worlds collide virtual xi contrary to received wisdom there are lots of cool moments on virtual xi and the spooky intro to when two worlds collide is one of them unfortunately the song then lumbers when it should soar its relatively lively and neat harmonies somehow lacking that essential maiden spark dl different world a matter of life and death unashamedly saluting the melodic power of thin lizzy the opening track on a matter of life and death is a straightforwardly incisive exercise in hard rock songwriting and strong evidence that bruce dickinson should sing in a lower register more often dl mother of mercy the final frontier reaffirming bruce dickinsons ability to hit notes that only dogs can hear mother of mercy is not an obvious highlight of the final frontier but it boasts a performance from bruce that will cheerfully take the paint from your walls the closing riff is enjoyably gnarly too dl blood on the worlds hands the x factor the xfactor is an album of shadowy terrors and slowmotion menace but it also has its fair share of quirky moments blood on the worlds hands starts with one of steve harris trademark roughhewn bass solos and then transforms into a grinding epic antiballad dl the nomad brave new world one of several maiden songs to transport us all to a vast bleak and sunravaged desert the nomad gave brave new world its most sumptuously epic moment a tribute to the rider of the desert sands its opulent sprawl deftly matches the subject matter scorched grain for grain dlembed

rock,on the first part of the journey i was looking at all the life there were plants and birds and rocks and things there was sand and hills and rings the first thing i met was a fly with a buzz and the sky with no clouds the heat was hot and the ground was dry but the air was full of sound i have been through the desert on a horse with no name it felt good to be out of the rain in the desert you can remember your name because there are not no one for to give you no pain la la la lala la la la la la la la la lala la la la la la after two days in the desert sun my skin began to turn red after three days in the desert fun i was looking at a river bed and the story it told of a river that flowed made me sad to think it was dead you see i have been through the desert on a horse with no name it felt good to be out of the rain in the desert you can remember your name because there are not no one for to give you no pain la la la lala la la la la la la la la lala la la la la la after nine days i let the horse run free because the desert had turned to sea there were plants and birds and rocks and things there was sand and hills and rings the ocean is a desert with its life underground and a perfect disguise above under the cities lies a heart made of ground but the humans will give no love you might also like you see i have been through the desert on a horse with no name it felt good to be out of the rain in the desert you can remember your name because there are not no one for to give you no pain la la la lala la la la la la la la la lala la la la la la la la la lala la la la la la la la la lala la la la la la la la la lala la la la la la la la la lala la la la la la la la la lala la la la la la la la la lala la la la la laembed
alternative,the schools in a portion of boston stretching from just south of south boston through roxbury and into dorchester are districted with a similar effect the predominantly black areas are cut away from the predominantly white areas morgan v hennigan yous district court for massachusetts the seek button on the fords radio is working the downtown recedes miles of neighborhoods fill the windshield the seek function locks on someplace in stereo college fm probably yeah a new friend says whas up whas goin on the radio has another button vol which gets jacked repeatedly while the ford hurtles happily to the source of the noise not to the stations broadcast booth on a campus across the river nor to its transmission towers in the suburbs but rather to rjam productions in north dorchester where black kids from bostons nowintegrated high schoolslatin madison park jeremiah burke mattapancut demos and dream of being bigger than even the radios new friend a young man named schoolly d who right now at speakerdamaging volume sounds darn big before we start this next record schoolys saying the record in question is called signifying rapper a brief bloody tale of ghetto retribution from side of schoollys smoke some kill the black areas are cut away from the white areas a federal judge ruled in and evidence is everywhere that nothings changed since then on the southbound left of the fitzgerald expressway pass blocks of grim irishcatholic housing projects the western border of belfast complete with sinn fein graffiti and murals depicting a glorious united ireland a neighborhood where the gadfly will get his fibula busted for praising the court order that bused them from wherever it is they livethe third world fer crissakesinto percentwhite south boston on the expressways right is the place the fibulabusters are talking about the simultaneous northern border of haiti jamaica and georgia a territory that maps of boston call north dorchester uniting the two sides of the expressway is just about nothing both neighborhoods are tough and poor both hate the college world across the river which because of bostons rotten public schools they will never see as freshmen and kids from both neighborhoods can do this hating to the beat of undergraduate radio which this fine morning features suburban kids with student debt broadcasting the art of a ghetto philadelphian roughly their age once much poorer than they but now on royalties from smoke some kill very much richer not that the shared digging of black street music is news or even new twenty years ago when morgan v hennigan bostons own brown v board of education was inching through the courts and even darkcomplected italians were sometimes unwelcome in the irish precincts east of the expressway kids in bostons little belfast sang along with james brown over the radio say it loud i am black and i am proud say it loud i am black and i am proud except that halfway through the infectious funk the crewcuts realize what they are saying jesus christ i am proud to be black fer chrissakes like when you are in the porno store you know and you get lost or something and you find yourself in the mens part you know not the part for men in the part that is about men jesus and you get the hell outta there and so they hummumble the suppressed parts say it loud i am mmm hum proud say it loud mum hum hum proud but rap is not funk rock or jazz and the vast crossover move broadcasting ghetto music over college radios to ghettos of a different color is no simple reenactment of past crossovers how for example does the singalong fan of smoke some kill mumble his way through these lines black is beautiful brown is sick slick stiff yellows ok but white are not shit rjam productions modestly headquartered in a mixed blackhispanic field corner section of north dorchester is as follows one fourcar garage fitted with dubbing and remastering gear worth more than most of the rest of the real estate on the block one touchtone telephone leased two chevy blazers vanityplated rjam and rjam each equipped with cellular phones and slick tape decks also leased one vcr with kathleen turners body heat cued up on the morning in question most importantly eight promising acts under binding contract if as has happened to many local labels rjam were liquidated to satisfy creditors these would be the pieces but there are stores of value in the converted garage beyond the reach of the auctioneers gavel schoolly d the original signifying rapper looms irresistibly from the pages of rap fanzines hiphop and the source and rjams prime unauctionable asset is the consuming ambition of the artists in its stable to be the next schoolly d or the next ice t or kool moe dee or l l cool j or whoevers the special hero of the kid cutting the demo on this particular morning the dream is to be the next mc lytea hardrapping woman known for jams like mc lyte vs vanna whyte and dissince today is tamtams day and tamtam is at a tough girl in the mc lyte mold who like mc lyte can dance look good and tell men to beat it all at once or so claims tamtams producer promoter and dutch uncle gary smith who opened rjam on martin luther kings birthday with his older brother nate nate the elder statesman is gary runs the company while nate travels with his boyhoodfriendturnedboss quadrupleplatinum princederived rappersinger bobby brown rjam was founded in part with an investment from the yearold multimillionaire brown a native of roxbury brown now lives in los angeles nate and gary smith turn a healthy profit making demos at tape but the brothers are not in the health business their aim to follow in the corporate footsteps of def jam a once similarly tiny production company run from a basement in hollis queens which since its basement days has given america public enemy l l cool j the beastie boys and much of the rest of that culturequake called rap gary smith does not compare rjam to def jam and unlike def jams russell simmons gary produces pop soul and rb as well as straight rap and actually prefers rb but how many sophomores at nearby jeremiah burke can afford to dream in rb to front music lessons and for an nthhand sound setup find three friends to learn drums bass and keyboards and then raise another to make a demo at rjam anybody with a larynx can rap however and rjams brisk business in rap demos pays the taxman boston edison and the chevrolet motor credit corp twenty minutes farther south on the fitzgerald expressway across the neponset river and into the pricey suburbs is the scene of john cheevers boyhood more recently celebrated as massachusetts miracle country where technology ventures are started at the rate of five per week four of which will fail within months rjams gary smith is secret brother to the men of the suburban chambers of commerce sharing their worries about cash flow overhead and the enforceability of his contracts but garys world and theirs are as far apart as those of ward and eldridge cleaver worriers in suburbia fear that ballooning property values will hike taxes on computer executives seaside homes in garys neighborhood property values are actually falling waiting less than patiently for tamtam gary honks twice a tall grave girl with an angels heartshaped face crosses the ghetto street and climbs into the back seat of rjam she has apparently at least two voices the cynical sexy rant heard on tape this morning telling pebbles men are not worth it and the whisper in which she now says hello as rjam recrosses north dorchester heading back to the soundproof studios to get the days work started gary and dj reese hash out production details tamtams a dignified island in the back seat and a shiver accompanies the thought that this could be the motor city in with berry gordy and an eightypound teenage diana ross just voted best dressed at cass technical high school driving crosstown to record a little number called where did our love go ask tamtam about diana ross and she gives a beatific smile she is she can remember only with difficulty the first rap she ever listened to when rap was new and she was rundmc or somebody she mumbles in response to what suddenly seems a foolish question about her influences like most of raps black audience as distinct from raps white audience which is usually a decade older tamtam has no firsthand recollection of james brown except as a source for rap she is too young to have attended segregated schools she was in diapers during the violent first few months of desegregation in boston and cannot remember the awful day in when proneighborhood marchers from irish south boston came upon a black pedestrian at city hall and beat him with polemounted american flags tamtam has star presence and like many who do she seems to see very little of what goes on around her the price of the stars intense focus on self she reminds you of senator gary hart he too had star presence in front of a crowd hart was riveting in the elevator riding up to the auditorium he was barely there being barely there in the neighborhood tamtam calls home is probably not such a bad thing and perhaps her drive to be star someday is an elaborate way to wall out the now and here ambition is finally a form of hope a scarce commodity in north dorchester back in rjams control booth dj reese and producer ralph stacey are programming the rhythm track for what will be ho you are guilty drum parts are taken from a roland tr rhythm composer a synth which electronically reproduces programmed beats on the users choice of drummatrix the trs keys on a console designed to resemble vaguely the familiar piano are named after the sound each createsbass snare midtom hitomand the sounds are named after the actual drums which until the tr were required to make those sounds the tr even sports a key named hand clap making it possible for the first time ever to clap hands with a single finger rendering obsolete the zen koan about the sound of one hand clapping the finished ho you are guilty will sound lush with percussion melody and instrumental breaks not one human musician will be employed in the recording process each percussion line is programmed onto the mixing board as a separate track a snare track a bass track a clap track etc reese has been studying the classics lately too viz james browns dead on the heavy funk from ish including the ageless groove funky president in which james announces his thirdparty candidacy some of bobby byrds dead guitar and a holy moment when james exhales rhythmically have been isolated from a storebought cassette of dead rerecorded on clean tape then rererecorded onto a computerreadable memory diskette from which the sample is retrieved and altered by ralph stacey using a roland d linear synth the guitar and the exhalation then go as altered from the synth to yet another of the tracks on the big mixing board reese the dj will weave a seamless rhythm track out of these strands as reese and ralph stacey mix the tracks onto one master tape tamtam sips lemonade in the corner of the booth you ask her if she is interested someday in learning about the obscure digital technology the two men manipulate on her behalf she does not seem to register the question the other career besides rap i would like to pursue is modelling she says i am fiveseven that is the perfect height for a model mixing takes the rest of the day producer ralph stacey at one late point corners you with a flinty stare and an uncomfortable question why do you want to write about rap anyway it is lucky that at that minute reese is done mixing tomorrow the rjam staff will tape tamtams vocal track and lay this over reeses rhythm track then the sound will be fattened with stacks of horns guitar hooks bells canned applause and whatever else they decide to take from other tapes or work up on the rolands the final demo tape of ho you are guilty will then be shopped to the major minor and tiny labels who might release the demo as a inch single everyone is ready to call it a day gary smiths already huddled with some new want tobe stars in rjams reception area reese plays the mixed rhythm track once through over the big speakers in the control booth and tamtam immediately stands modelling forgotten utterly alert reese gestures to her

funk d a grad student and wouldbe drifter who watches tv instead of sleeping our cultural tastes and interests are day and night they converged only lately when ds stereo arrived ups and we discovered we shared an uncomfortable somewhat furtive and distinctively white enthusiasm for a certain music called raphiphop about our passions and discomforts we could determine only that they were vague distinct contexts and cathexes brought to bear across the same ethnic distance on the same thing for instance we agreed that real or serious rap is not jj fad or tone loc or beasties egyptian lover or

lucrative to an anemic shockand rebellionmusic industry as punk was an exact decade ago this was all just data we agreed on it and on how it was curious that we both had such strange distant facts down cold our point of departure essaywise was always less what we know than what we felt listening less what we liked than why for this attempt at an outside sampler we plunked down and listened to thousands of hours of rap trying to summon a kind of objective critical purely aesthetic passion that the music itself made impossible for outsiders raps easy to move to hard to dissect the more we listened and thought and drank beers and argued the more we felt that the stuffs appeal for two highbrow upscale whites was just plain incongruous because serious rap has right from the start presented itself as a closed show usually critical questions of culture context background and audience reduce quickly to vexed questions about prepositions not here no question that serious rap is and is very selfconsciously music by urban blacks about same to and for same to mainstream whites it is a tight cohesion that cannot but look from outside the cultural window like occlusion clannishness sic and inbreeding a kind of re snobbery about what is def and fresh and inthescene that eerily recalls the exclusionary codes of college societies and wasponly country clubs serious rap is a musical movement that seems to revile whites as a group or establishment and simply to ignore their possibility as distinct individualsthe great white male is raps grand inquisitor its idiot questionerits alien other no less than reds were for mccarthy the musics paranoia together with its hermetic racial context helps explain why from the outside it appears to us just as vibrant and impassioned as it does alien and scary other incongruities rap is a music essentially without melody built instead around a digitally synthesized drum and backbeat often about as complex as five idle fingers on a waitingroom table enhanced by sampled pirated krush grooves licks or repetitive chordseries conceived and recorded by prerap rock icons the whole affair characterized by a distinctive spare noisy clattering style whose obsessive if limited thematics revolve with the speed of lowi amperage around the performative circuit of the mcrapper and his recordscratching soundmixing sancho panza the dj the rapper the guy in the cameo cut or kangol hat pricey warmup unlaced adidas extra thick gold chain or oversized medallion offers lyrics that are spoken or bellowed in straight stressed rhymed the s syntax and meter often tortured for rhythmic gain or the kind of limboingforrhyme we tend to associate with doggerel about men from nantucket the lyrics nearly always selfreferential tend to be variations on about half a dozen basic themes themes that at first listen can seem less alien or shocking than downright dull eg just how badcoolfreshdef the rapper and his lyrics are just how equally unallthese his music rivals are how troublesome vacuous and acquisitive women are how wonderful it is to be paid in full for rapping instead of stealing or dealing how gangs are really families caines constant bad news and in particular how sex and violence and yuppie toys represent perfectly the urban black lifedrive to lates american glory the masks are many too many for anything really but direct aural inspection rap personae can change frequently even within single albums the rapper delivering hard violent black nationalist communique on one cut dubbing against trinidadian steel drums on another basking in big label eclat on a third cracking a head and then defly outwitting someone muscled and dumb cooing to his bitch and then on the flip side threatening to go get his gun again if she cannot learn who is boss though any crew naturally wants its own distinctive game and face the quintessential rap group is unquintessential chameleonesque this is either by weird design or it is a symptom and symbol of s facelessnessor most likely it is just a good old venerable synecdoche of raps genre itself one that is now moving so fast it cannot quite fix on its own identity much less hold still for anything like cool critical classification or assessment from outside the mcs alice toklasesque dj hovers ever nearby over his buffet of connected turntables and the black germanness of a whole lot of digital editing playback equipment his responsibility is the song behind and around the rap the backbeat krush groove and the sound carpet ie a kind of electric aural environment a chaos behind the rappers rhymed order a digitalized blend of snippets squeaks screams sirens snatches from pop media all mixed and splattered so that the listener cannot really listen but only feel the resultant mash of samples that results the most recognizable of these samples range from staccato recordscratches to james brown and funkadelic licks to mlks public dream to quotidian pop pap like the theme from shaft brady bunch dialogue and s detergent commercials we have now read every review and essay to do with serious underground hiphop available in every single online periodical xcept for one or two underground newsletters viz the city sun freshest circulated in parts of the bronx demimonde where learning about rap is as hard for white outsiders as scoring fine china white or aks from the kind of sedulous bibliomaniacal research to be expected of conscientious lawyers and phds the following has become clear outside england where the punkweaned audience has developed a taste for spectaclethroughwindows for vicarious rage and protest against circumstances that have exactly to do with them most of what rolling stone calls devoted rock consumers meaning we postbabyboomers plus almost all established rock critics tend to regard noncrossover rap as essentially boring and simplistic or swaggering and bellicose and dangerousat all events basically vapid and empty because of its obsessive selfreferentialityin short as closed to them to us as a music unrecognizable as what we have been trained and adverted to buy as pop great to dance to of course but then what might the white audience for todays mainstream expect rap whether fecund or sterile is todays pop musics lone cutting edge the new the unfamiliar the brainresistedwhilebodyboogies and that resisted alien exhilarating cutting edge has always been black what have you left me what have i got last night in cold blood my young brother got shot my homey got jacked my mothers on crack my sister cannot work because her arms show tracks madness insanity live in profanity then some punk claim that they understandin me give me a breakwhat world do you live in death is my sexguess my religion what makes this stuff so much more disturbing more real to outsiders than the punk rock even those of us who remember it could never quite take seriously maybe even a closed music has to have some kind of detente with received custom i always found it tough to listen straightfaced to a nihilist lecture from someone with a chartreuse mohawk and an earring in his eyelid who punctuates his delivery with vomit and spit all doctrine and pronouncement exclusively anti this punk of a decade past afforded even willing mainstream listeners no easement across cultural void nothing human to grab onto i have no idea what a punk performer thinks feels is daytoday in fact i always suspected he had no day but just retreated to his plush coffin at cockcrow can you imagine a punk with fourfoot hair and spiked jacket and nosering say eating a bologna sandwich replacing a light bulb putting a quarter in a meter not me boy and even barnum who knew fear sells also knew that freakshows are not frightening when the freakishness supplants all resemblance affinity empathy and fear requires empathy as much as it does menace or threat public enemy and nwa ice t and schoolly d discomfit us our friends the critics we read and cornered because the hard rappers lyrics are conscientious about being offor the real lives and attitudes of recognizable if alien persons here is where it is a level up from mere spectacle ideology in hard rap is always informed by incident or named condition this makes rap not only better than punk but way scarier serious hard raps afford white listeners genuine horsesmouth access to the lifeanddeath plight and mood of an american community on the genuine edge of i amexplosion an ugly new subnation we have been heretofore conditioned to avoid remand to the margins not even see except through certain carefully abstract attenuating filters for outsiders rap is hard to dissect easy to move to the command is dance do not understand participate do not manipulate rap is a fortress protected by the twin moats of talk and technology the first is that nu style of speakthe dialect drug de la soul calls itthat rappers fashion from jive and disseminate through record stores to all of us some inwords like fly meaning finelooking have been in coin since the beginning now venerable as old english because they turn up on grandmaster flash cuts from others like dead presidents rap for are either coming into or going out of currency depending on when you read this rap a club language has myriad ways to describe ones own or others looks fly is how a man digs a woman one would never describe oneself as fly even when cataloguing ones own attractions done more in rap than anyplace except perhaps village voice personals fresh means irresistibly stylish oftmodified by funky crazy or stoopid predominantly used to convey the flyness of things other than women including oneself or ones rap which two concepts rappers like schizophrenics cannot always keep separate in their heads dope means def and def means crazy funky stoopid fresh synonyms include the shit the it the cool the thang the word the grooviest the categorical imperative die weltanschung the thatwhichpotterstewartwouldknowifhesaw a def rapper is so styledefining as to make the stylish mere copycats to be def is to rap to the beat of a different drum machinenot seeking solitude but rather confident that others will follow the def rapper mcs a def rap which rap defly tells of its own and the rappers defnessso def as mcmanager entrepreneur russell rush simmons brags that it had to be on a label called def jam rap celebrates power equating strength with style and style with the i in individuality rappers disdismissthe styleless faceless to ill is to be weak or wrong to bite is to thieve anothers dope beat and only the ill would bite early remastered pop was the first fake music ever since what the record buyer of experienced as aural event on his turntable could not happen live rock began to become an illusion of event which technology made possible rock became more like the movies starting down a long road at the end of which was mtv not that this kept phil spector up nights the gurus of the studio had fatter fish to clean for the new freedom to shape sound had come at a price with each magnetic jump from live as tape was made of tapes which were themselves tapes of tapes the hiss and crackle of interference multiplied dual highbias media with units each of sonic garbage per units of elvis presley retaped on similar unitsper tape became units of hiss retaped then then as the sound got fuller it decayed the solution was a breakthrough called multitrackingusing recorders that could capture and play back on as in stereo as in s thenearshattering sergeant peppers lonely hearts club band and today parallel tracks eliminating the hiss of transference from one machine to the next rhythms melodies harmonies could all be captured on separate tracks allowing the performer or producer to mix and listen and remix adding vocals or lead instrument on yet another track rap edisons like kool herc grandmaster flash and afrika bambaataa began as party djs not musicians their wiring of twin turntables to a mixer allowing them to stack the sound of two different records while rapping into a mike was a kind of crude extemporaneous multitracking technological loops like those in the nasaesque studios of cbs and polygram were now in the hands of the homeboys carter was president the bee gees with five topten hits in twelve months were king digital recording the science dividing rjams tamtam on tape from tamtam as heard live is a technology that converts music to codes or digits the codes are read by a computer one combining sophisticated soundtocode translation hardware with a numbercrunching cos and a highresponse synthesizer at speeds of digits per second and up the recorded sounds reduced to numbers can be shaped mangled muffled amplified and even canonized hardware then translates the digits as read and altered back into sound which can itself be recorded on multitrack and combined with yet more sounds the result hissfree reproduction on an infinity of tracks each of which can itself be manipulated infinitely digital recording part of the s seachange in how pop gets made divides the responsibility for the final song more or less equally between the performer the engineer at the mixing board the producer who coordinates the multitracking and mixing process and the electronic hardware that actually makes the music we buy the latest synthesizers produce notes from pure electric current instead of electronically amplified vibrations with voltagemeters rather than hands or feet determining everything from key to pitch to timbre to attackdelay envelope another nonrap term denoting the microtimed counterpoised quality of a notes duration how a notes soundquaverstructure as it builds is different from its sound and structure as it fadesthe manipulation of a pianos footpedals for example affects the delay component of each note and chords envelope the kurzweil a stateoftheart system is a tracknote synthesizer linked by software to an apple macintosh plus which serves as an exhaustive library of digitized sound the kurzweil could put all of culture in a blendertake janet leighs cremoracurdling scream from psycho store it in the mac program the synth such that an f will be reproduced as janet leighs f scream then play we shall overcome as if screamed by janet leigh store this treat similarly bachs st matthews passion except with vast es of screaming janet leighs then mary had a little lamb then twist and shout by the isleys not the beatles all as screams then replay the four as one horrific jumble or select amidst the jumble and then whatever you came up with in the final painstakingly remixed mix you could play backwards and call that finished or never finish it is like holding music at gunpoint you can make it door do to you whatever you can think of whim is the only limit basically we decided we were into rap because even mediahype aside this music had some kind of hard edge to it date of composition here is july think back this last has been a fiscal year in which madonnas back on top in which covers of classic covers of classic tunes are themselves covered and then climb corporate charts in which rod stewarts out of cryogenics and back on top mtvs ceased to be anything but a long commercial for itself and the interests of corporate labels bobby mcferrin makes a platinum mint and then several commercial jingles out of a burbled synthreggae invitation to be happy a song that has the same verbalprepackaging feel as where is the beef this last year heavy metals fakesatanist male models accounted for of total yous record sales you filmed a homage to their own selfrighteousness and bonos ever more illdisguised megalomania a year when even good old rem finally went corporatepop with green when good old springsteen trashed his bride when as modest and nascent a talent as tracy chapman earned cymbalcrashing critical raves for her competent updated frappe of baez and armatrading so desperate were pop critics and consumers for any voice at once comprehensible and even remotely fresh just not a notable pop year at all except in rap rap appears in the famished late s as potentially a genuine musical scene the way early jazz rock the summer of love folkprotest god even the way new wave and punk were scenesthe sword here simultaneously meaning something new to look at something loud and upsetting oh please veronica let us not have a scene and best an identifiable set of places in time where large forces meet marry and beget whether by virtue or default rap is pretty much what there is to like right now if you want to regard todays pop as anything more than covert jingles in time in our opinion but so the point is we enjoy it plus we have developed some theses about why serious rap is important both as artforownsake and as a kind of metaphorwithlarynx for a subbedculture unique in its distillation of the energy and horror of the american present rap is expanding gaslike through the s dry time growing from house party schtick gang anthem a smalllabel fad with the sort of pop lifespan you measure with eggtimersthen somehow when we were not looking into scene movement on the airfinally in the last months assuming the fecund role of genuine genre exploding into subspecies now faster than you can track there is now dubs mix of rap and reggae houses mix of rap and s hugeafrod funk acid houses psychedelic hiphop there is black rap for white massconsumption tone loc rundmc black rap for local set and house consumption countless local stars and want tobes in every large city ultrablack rap superstars for the whole marginal nation inside heavy d public enemy big daddy kane white rap for white masses the execrable beastie boys there is hispanic salsainfluenced rap out of different west coast barrios rap fused with west indian or islamic traditional music in digital underground eric b and rakim and others or fused with ohsodanceable rb in the new jack swing offshoot bobby brown mc hammer even gay and bohemian young urban bs have their trendsetters in teddy riley and guy de la soul kwabe etc etc a major impediment to sampling this scene is the kaleidoscopic fury with which the scene itself is changing if you are reading this in print it is already dated and the rap worlds vitality is one of replacement as well as variety allowing the genre to remain fresh as band after band is seduced into the real music biz this scene is hydralike almost the moment a rap artist like rundmc or l l cool j breaks through into majormarket mix appeal mtvs land of corporate bankability certain reactions within the urban underground that spawned them can almost always be observed the breakthrough bands bboys themselves are without qualms about the pop bigtime after all they have been rapping all along about their entitlement to money and status about the inevitable rewards of their freshness and unbiteable voice their postbreakthrough raps tend all often to become celebrations of their new wealth and fame of the nowenhanced authority of their messagethough it is hard to feature public enemy rapping about a blackmilitant renaissance about revolution and american apocalypse while lilywhite cbs records pays them millions for the distribution rights to just such exhortations to cut corporate throats nevertheless back in the underground scene the breakthrough bands tight set of original fans tends to hang loyal to await feverishly their crews spots on the same music tv they love to dis in short there are comparatively few of the accusations of selling out that accompanied a similarly oxymoronic coopting phenomenon in lates protest rock which if you think about it is passing strange the white mainstream other against which serious rap aligns and defines itself makes the s establishment too look downright benign our opinion then from a distance not only is a serious rap serious poetry but in terms of the size of its audience its potency in the great s market its power to spur and to authorize the artistic endeavor of a discouraged and malschooled young urban culture we have been encouraged sadly to write off it is quite possibly the most important stuff happening in american poetry today real viz academic yous poetry a world no less insular than rap no less strange or stringent about vocab manner and the contexts it works off has today become so inbred and against its professed wishes inaccessible that it just does not get to share its creative products with more than a couple thousand fanatical sandalshod readers does not get to move or inform more than a fraction of that readership most of the moved being poets themselves does not generate revenue for much of anyone save the universities to whom the best phdpoets rent their names and time and especially does not inspire a whole cultures youth to try to follow in their connecticutcatalogue brogans prints because of raps meteoric rise though you have got poor kids tough kids underachievers a lost generation more young peopleostensibly forever turned off language by tv video games and low yousde budgetsmore of these kids hunched over notebooks on their own time trying to put words together in striking and creative ways than the yousa has probably ever had at one time that few of these will become stars matters far less than the grim stats about say the tiny percentage of playground basketball phenoms who actually ride sports out and up from subclass status the same verbal skills and enthusiasms rap values and values enough to let rapdissing stand symbolically for fighting or killing can obviously be applied in mainstreamapproved productive waysgeds college standard written english perhaps someday even adcopywriting but is this wildfire of urban rap ambition raging around converted fourcar garages like north dorchesters rjams in spite of the genres neardisciplinary prosodic restrictions or because of them cannot really tell probably does not matter the fact remains that were important poetry presently defined in terms of what makes important art important in a supplyside democracy popularity effect the separation of fan from his cash staid journals like poetry and american poetry review would be featuring some number of fadecut multipleearringd authors photos in each issue and highbrow public readings would always carry their back row fraction of bangers ready to listen rude to wilbur and levertov and ashbery just as eg rimbaud and pound did to their own contemporaries to the delight and invigoration of a times poetry and even just the prospected fantasy of seeing public enemys beclocked flavor fav and like a jorie graham or amy clampitt sitting down over beer and celestial seasonings to hash out the debate over linebreaks in dactylic pentameter a very serious young homeboy in italian silk and pentagonal shades serving as interpreter is enough to make us hereby officially lobby for the admission of rhymes renaissanceat least under the stringent rhythmic demands rap has forced on rhymeasformto the cold corridors of serious appreciation unlike the mostly docile poetry and fiction of the late s though raps own quality the def freshness of the mcs bit is set up to be judged primarily in the context of what it is against in case you thought we forgot rap is first of all a movement in rock music and thus the timehonored requirement is that the rap scene set itself very consciously athwart those circumstances and forces whose enormity is required by all rock n roll to justify one of its essential roles rebellionagainst except now watch the objects of the rebellion alter spread grow in

powder those lithely syncopated quintets in pomade and linen suits the single hand in the white glove holding pepsi aloft in the shadow of accidental flames black music is american pops breath and bread and we as both born audience and born salesmen know it so maybe it is them them maybe we are approaching an enforced fork in the musical road where the whiterun entertainment industry will have to pack up what it is taken and go seek its fortune on the backs of new minorities maybe in serious rap the extreme new insulation of the black sound is not only intentional but preplanned part of a neonationalist agenda the hermetic new scenes tight circle more like something large and coiled than something small and flat you may now be getting some hazy idea of the sorts of really quite scary possibilities with which the rap we like is replete and hazier of how complicated this stuff of samplerfromoutside can be what is remained passing strange for use is the vague threats appeal the unease and ambivalence with which the rare white at the window loves rap renders that love no less love whence the fear though is really no matter for look at the world at the masses we are part of at

rock,madame swann at home a break in the narrative old friends in new aspects the marquis de norpois bergotte how i cease for the time being to see gilberte a general outline of the sorrow caused by a parting and of the irregular process of oblivion my mother when it was a question of our having m de norpois to dinner for the first time having expressed her regret that professor cottard was away from home and that she herself had quite ceased to see anything of swann since either of these might have helped to entertain the old ambassador my father replied that so eminent a guest so distinguished a man of science as cottard could never be out of place at a dinnertable but that swann with his ostentation his habit of crying aloud from the housetops the name of everyone that he knew however slightly was an impossible vulgarian whom the marquis de norpois would be sure to dismiss as to use his own epithet a pestilent fellow now this attitude on my fathers part may be felt to require a few words of explanation inasmuch as some of us no doubt remember a cottard of distinct mediocrity and a swann by whom modesty and discretion in all his social relations were carried to the utmost refinement of delicacy but in his case what had happened was that to the original young swann and also to the swann of the jockey club our old friend had added a fresh personality which was not to be his last that of odettes husband adapting to the humble ambitions of that lady the instinct the desire the industry which he had always had he had laboriously constructed for himself a long way beneath the old a new position more appropriate to the companion who was to share it with him in this he shewed himself another man since while he continued to go by himself to the houses of his own friends on whom he did not care to inflict odette unless they had expressly asked that she should be introduced to them it was a new life that he had begun to lead in common with his wife among a new set of people it was quite intelligible that in order to estimate the importance of these new friends and thereby the pleasure the selfesteem that were to be derived from entertaining them he should have made use as a standard of comparison not of the brilliant society in which he himself had moved before his marriage but of the earlier environment of odette and yet even when one knew that it was with unfashionable officials and their faded wives the wallflowers of ministerial ballrooms that he was now anxious to associate it was still astonishing to hear him who in the old days and even still would so gracefully refrain from mentioning an invitation to twickenham or to marlborough house proclaim with quite unnecessary emphasis that the wife of some assistant undersecretary for something had returned mme swanns call it will perhaps be objected here that what this really implied was that the simplicity of the fashionable swann had been nothing more than a supreme refinement of vanity and that like certain other israelites my parents old friend had contrived to illustrate in turn all the stages through which his race had passed from the crudest and coarsest form of snobbishness up to the highest pitch of good manners but the chief reason and one which is applicable to humanity as a whole was that our virtues themselves are not free and floating qualities over which we retain a permanent control and power of disposal they come to be so closely linked in our minds with the actions in conjunction with which we make it our duty to practise them that if we are suddenly called upon to perform some action of a different order it takes us by surprise and without our supposing for a moment that it might involve the bringing of those very same virtues into play swann in his intense consciousness of his new social surroundings and in the pride with which he referred to them was like those great artists modest or generous by nature who if at the end of their career they take to cooking or to gardening display a childlike gratification at the compliments that are paid to their dishes or their borders and will not listen to any of the criticism which they heard unmoved when it was applied to their real achievements or who after giving away a canvas cannot conceal their annoyance if they lose a couple of francs at dominoes as for professor cottard we shall meet him again and can study him at our leisure much later in the course of our story with the mistress mme verdurin in her country house la raspeliere for the present the following observations must suffice first of all in the case of swann the alteration might indeed be surprising since it had been accomplished and yet was not suspected by me when i used to see gilbertes father in the champselysées where moreover as he never spoke to me he could not very well have made any display of his political relations it is true that if he had done so i might not at once have discerned his vanity for the idea that one has long held of a person is apt to stop ones eyes and ears my mother for three whole years had no more noticed the salve with which one of her nieces used to paint her lips than if it had been wholly and invisibly dissolved in some clear liquid until one day a streak too much or possibly something else brought about the phenomenon known as supersaturation all the paint that had hitherto passed unperceived was now crystallised and my mother in the face of this sudden riot of colour declared in the best combray manner that it was a perfect scandal and almost severed relations with her niece with cottard on the contrary the epoch in which we have seen him assisting at the first introduction of swann to the verdurins was now buried in the past whereas honours offices and titles come with the passage of years moreover a man may be illiterate and make stupid puns and yet have a special gift which no amount of general culture can replace such as the gift of a great strategist or physician and so it was not merely as an obscure practitioner who had attained in course of time to european celebrity that the rest of his profession regarded cottard the most intelligent of the younger doctors used to assert for a year or two that is to say for fashions being themselves begotten of the desire for change are quick to change also that if they themselves ever fell ill cottard was the only one of the leading men to whom they would entrust their lives no doubt they preferred socially to meet certain others who were better read more artistic with whom they could discuss nietzsche and wagner when there was a musical party at mme cottards on the evenings when she entertained in the hope that it might one day make him dean of the faculty the colleagues and pupils of her husband he instead of listening preferred to play cards in another room yet everybody praised the quickness the penetration the unerring confidence with which at a glance he could diagnose disease thirdly in considering the general impression which professor cottard must have made on a man like my father we must bear in mind that the character which a man exhibits in the latter half of his life is not always even if it is often his original character developed or withered attenuated or enlarged it is sometimes the exact opposite like a garment that has been turned except from the verdurins who were infatuated with him cottards hesitating manner his excessive timidity and affability had in his young days called down upon him endless taunts and sneers what charitable friend counselled that glacial air the importance of his professional standing made it all the more easy to adopt wherever he went save at the verdurins where he instinctively became himself again he would assume a repellent coldness remain silent as long as possible be peremptory when he was obliged to speak and not forget to say the most cutting things he had every opportunity of rehearsing this new attitude before his patients who seeing him for the first time were not in a position to make comparisons and would have been greatly surprised to learn that he was not at all a rude man by nature complete impassivity was what he strove to attain and even while visiting his hospital wards when he allowed himself to utter one of those puns which left everyone from the house physician to the junior student helpless with laughter he would always make it without moving a muscle of his face while even that was no longer recognisable now that he had shaved off his beard and moustache but who the reader has been asking was the marquis de norpois well he had been minister plenipotentiary before the war and was actually an ambassador on the sixteenth of may in spite of which and to the general astonishment he had since been several times chosen to represent france on extraordinary missions even as controller of the public debt in egypt where thanks to his great capability as a financier he had rendered important services by radical cabinets under which a reactionary of the middle classes would have declined to serve and in whose eyes m de norpois in view of his past his connexions and his opinions ought presumably to have been suspect but these advanced ministers seemed to consider that in making such an appointment they were shewing how broad their own minds were when the supreme interests of france were at stake were raising themselves above the general run of politicians were meriting from the journal des débats itself the title of statesmen and were reaping direct advantage from the weight that attaches to an aristocratic name and the dramatic interest always aroused by an unexpected appointment and they knew also that they could reap these advantages by making an appeal to m de norpois without having to fear any want of political loyalty on his part a fault against which his noble birth not only need not put them on their guard but offered a positive guarantee and in this calculation the government of the republic were not mistaken in the first place because an aristocrat of a certain type brought up from his cradle to regard his name as an integral part of himself of which no accident can deprive him an asset of whose value his peers or persons of even higher rank can form a fairly exact estimate knows that he can dispense with the efforts since they can in no way enhance his position in which without any appreciable result so many public men of the middle class spend themselves to profess only the right opinions to frequent only the sound people anxious on the other hand to increase his own importance in the eyes of the princely or ducal families which take immediate precedence of his own he knows that he can do so by giving his name that complement which hitherto it has lacked which will give it priority over other names heraldically its equals such as political power a literary or an artistic reputation or a large fortune and so what he saves by avoiding the society of the ineffective country squires after whom all the professional families run helterskelter but of his intimacy with whom were he to profess it a prince would think nothing he will lavish on the politicians who freemasons or worse though they be can advance him in diplomacy or back him in an election and on the artists or scientists whose patronage can help him to arrive in those departments in which they excel on everyone in fact who is in a position to confer a fresh distinction or to bring off a rich marriage but in the character of m de norpois there was this predominant feature that in the course of a long career of diplomacy he had become imbued with that negative methodical conservative spirit called governmental which is common to all governments and under every government particularly inspires its foreign office he had imbibed during that career an aversion a dread a contempt for the methods of procedure more or less revolutionary and in any event quite incorrect which are those of an opposition save in the case of a few illiterates high or low it makes no matter by whom no difference in quality is perceptible what attracts men one to another is not a common point of view but a consanguinity of spirit an academician of the kind of legouvé and therefore an upholder of the classics would applaud maxime ducamps or mezieres eulogy of victor hugo with more fervour than that of boileau by claudel a common nationalism suffices to endear barrés to his electors who scarcely distinguish between him and m georges berry but does not endear him to those of his brother academicians who with a similar outlook on politics but a different type of mind will prefer to him even such open adversaries as m ribot and m deschanel with whom in turn the most loyal monarchists feel themselves more closely allied than with maurras or léon daudet although these also are living in the hope of a glorious restoration miserly in the use of words not only from a professional scruple of prudence and reserve but because words themselves have more value present more subtleties of definition to men whose efforts protracted over a decade to bring two countries to an understanding are condensed translated in a speech or in a protocol into a single adjective colourless in all appearance but to them pregnant with a world of meaning m de norpois was considered very stiff at the commission where he sat next to my father whom everyone else congratulated on the astonishing way in which the old ambassador unbent to him my father was himself more astonished than anyone for not being as a rule very affable his company was little sought outside his own intimate circle a limitation which he used modestly and frankly to avow he realised that these overtures were an outcome in the diplomat of that point of view which everyone adopts for himself in making his choice of friends from which all a mans intellectual qualities his refinement his affection are a far less potent recommendation of him when at the same time he bores or irritates one than are the mere straightforwardness and goodhumour of another man whom most people would regard as frivolous or even fatuous de norpois has asked me to dinner again it is quite extraordinary everyone on the commission is amazed as he never has any personal relations with any of us i am sure he is going to tell me something thrilling again about the seventy war my father knew that m de norpois had warned had perhaps been alone in warning the emperor of the growing strength and bellicose designs of prussia and that bismarck rated his intelligence most highly only the other day at the opera during the gala performance given for king theodosius the newspapers had all drawn attention to the long conversation which that monarch had held with m de norpois i must ask him whether the kings visit had any real significance my father went on for he was keenly interested in foreign politics i know old norpois keeps very close as a rule but when he is with me he opens out quite charmingly as for my mother perhaps the ambassador had not the type of mind towards which she felt herself most attracted i should add that his conversation furnished so exhaustive a glossary of the superannuated forms of speech peculiar to a certain profession class and period a period which for that profession and that class might be said not to have altogether passed away that i sometimes regret that i have not kept any literal record simply of the things that i have heard him say i should thus have obtained an effect of oldfashioned courtesy by the same process and at as little expense as that actor at the palaisroyal who when asked where on earth he managed to find his astounding hats answered i do not find my hats i keep them in a word i suppose that my mother considered m de norpois a trifle outofdate which was by no means a fault in her eyes so far as manners were concerned but attracted her less in the region not in this instance of ideas for those of m de norpois were extremely modern but of idiom she felt however that she was paying a delicate compliment to her husband when she spoke admiringly of the diplomat who had shewn so remarkable a predilection for him by confirming in my fathers mind the good opinion that he already had of m de norpois and so inducing him to form a good opinion of himself also she knew that she was carrying out that one of her wifely duties which consisted in making life pleasant and comfortable for her husband just as when she saw to it that his dinner was perfectly cooked and served in silence and as she was incapable of deceiving my father she compelled herself to admire the old ambassador so as to be able to praise him with sincerity incidentally she could naturally and did appreciate his kindness his somewhat antiquated courtesy so ceremonious that when as he was walking along the street his tall figure rigidly erect he caught sight of my mother driving past before raising his hat to her he would fling away the cigar that he had just lighted his conversation so elaborately circumspect in which he referred as seldom as possible to himself and always considered what might interest the person to whom he was speaking his promptness in answering a letter which was so astonishing that whenever my father just after posting one himself to m de norpois saw his handwriting upon an envelope his first thought was always one of annoyance that their letters must unfortunately have crossed in the post which one was led to suppose bestowed upon him the special and luxurious privilege of extraordinary deliveries and collections at all hours of the day and night my mother marvelled at his being so punctilious although so busy so friendly although so much in demand never realising that although with such people is invariably an unrecognised because and that just as old men are always wonderful for their age and kings extraordinarily simple and country cousins astonishingly wellinformed it was the same system of habits that enabled m de norpois to undertake so many duties and to be so methodical in answering letters to go everywhere and to be so friendly when he came to us moreover she made the mistake which everyone makes who is unduly modest she rated everything that concerned herself below and consequently outside the range of other peoples duties and engagements the letter which it seemed to her so meritorious in my fathers friend to have written us promptly since in the course of the day he must have had ever so many letters to write she excepted from that great number of letters of which actually it was a unit in the same way she did not consider that dining with us was for m de norpois merely one of the innumerable activities of his social life she never guessed that the ambassador had trained himself long ago to look upon diningout as one of his diplomatic functions and to display at table an inveterate charm which it would have been too much to have expected him specially to discard when he came to dine with us the evening on which m de norpois first appeared at our table in a year when i still went to play in the champselysées has remained fixed in my memory because the afternoon of the same day was that upon which i at last went to hear berma at a matinée in phedre and also because in talking to m de norpois i realised suddenly and in a new and different way how completely the feelings aroused in me by all that concerned gilberte swann and her parents differed from any that the same family could inspire in anyone else it was no doubt the sight of the depression in which i was plunged by the approach of the new year holidays in which as she herself had informed me i was to see nothing of gilberte that prompted my mother one day in the hope of distracting my mind to suggest if you are still so anxious to hear berma i think that your father would allow you perhaps to go your grandmother can take you but it was because m de norpois had told him that he ought to let me hear berma that it was an experience for a young man to remember in later life that my father who had hitherto been so resolutely opposed to my going and wasting my time with the added risk of my falling ill again on what he used to shock my grandmother by calling futilities was now not far from regarding this manner of spending an afternoon as included in some vague way in the list of precious formulae for success in a brilliant career my grandmother who in renouncing on my behalf the profit which according to her i should have derived from hearing berma had made a considerable sacrifice in the interests of my health was surprised to find that this last had become of no account at a mere word from m de norpois reposing the unconquerable hopes of her rationalist spirit in the strict course of fresh air and early hours which had been prescribed for me she now deplored as something disastrous this infringement that i was to make of my rules and in a tone of despair protested how easily led you are to my father who replied angrily what so it is you that are not for letting him go now that is really too much after your telling us all day and every day that it would be so good for him m de norpois had also brought about a change in my fathers plans in a matter of far greater importance to myself my father had always meant me to become a diplomat and i could not endure the thought that even if i did have to stay for some years first at the ministry i should run the risk of being sent later on as ambassador to capitals in which no gilberte dwelt i should have preferred to return to the literary career that i had planned for myself and had been abandoned years before in my wanderings along the guermantes way but my father had steadily opposed my devoting myself to literature which he regarded as vastly inferior to diplomacy refusing even to dignify it with the title of career until the day when m de norpois who had little love for the more recent generations of diplomatic agents assured him that it was quite possible by writing to attract as much attention to receive as much consideration to exercise as much influence and at the same time to preserve more independence than in the embassies well well i should never have believed it old norpois does not at all disapprove of your idea of taking up writing my father had reported and as he had a certain amount of influence himself he imagined that there was nothing that could not be arranged no problem for which a happy solution might not be found in the conversation of people who counted i shall bring him back to dinner one of these days from the commission you must talk to him a little and let him see what he thinks of you write something good that you can shew him he is an intimate friend of the editor of the deuxmondes he will get you in there he will arrange it all the cunning old fox and upon my soul he seems to think that diplomacy nowadays my happiness in the prospect of not being separated from gilberte made me desirous but not capable of writing something good which could be shewn to m de norpois after a few laboured pages weariness made the pen drop from my fingers i cried with anger at the thought that i should never have any talent that i was not gifted that i could not even take advantage of the chance that m de norpoiss coming visit was to offer me of spending the rest of my life in paris the recollection that i was to be taken to hear berma alone distracted me from my grief but just as i did not wish to see any storms except on those coasts where they raged with most violence so i should not have cared to hear the great actress except in one of those classic parts in which swann had told me that she touched the sublime for when it is in the hope of making a priceless discovery that we desire to receive certain impressions from nature or from works of art we have certain scruples about allowing our soul to gather instead of these other inferior impressions which are liable to make us form a false estimate of the value of beauty berma in andromaque in les caprices de marianne in phedre was one of those famous spectacles which my imagination had so long desired i should enjoy the same rapture as on the day when in a gondola i glided to the foot of the titian of the frari or the carpaccios of san giorgio dei schiavoni were i ever to hear berma repeat the lines beginning on dit quun prompt départ vous éloigne de nous seigneur i was familiar with them from the simple reproduction in black and white which was given of them upon the printed page but my heart beat furiously at the thought as of the realisation of a longplanned voyage that i should at length behold them bathed and brought to life in the atmosphere and sunshine of the voice of gold a carpaccio in venice berma in phedre masterpieces of pictorial or dramatic art which the glamour the dignity attaching to them made so living to me that is to say so indivisible that if i had been taken to see carpaccios in one of the galleries of the louvre or berma in some piece of which i had never heard i should not have experienced the same delicious amazement at finding myself at length with wideopen eyes before the unique and inconceivable object of so many thousand dreams then while i waited expecting to derive from bermas playing the revelation of certain aspects of nobility and tragic grief it would seem to me that whatever greatness whatever truth there might be in her playing must be enhanced if the actress imposed it upon a work of real value instead of what would after all be but embroidering a pattern of truth and beauty upon a commonplace and vulgar web finally if i went to hear berma in a new piece it would not be easy for me to judge of her art of her diction since i should not be able to differentiate between a text which was not already familiar and what she added to it by her intonations and gestures an addition which would seem to me to be embodied in the play itself whereas the old plays the classics which i knew by heart presented themselves to me as vast and empty walls reserved and made ready for my inspection on which i should be able to appreciate without restriction the devices by which berma would cover them as with frescoes with the perpetually fresh treasures of her inspiration unfortunately for some years now since she had retired from the great theatres to make the fortune of one on the boulevards where she was the star she had ceased to appear in classic parts and in vain did i scan the hoardings they never advertised any but the newest pieces written specially for her by authors in fashion at the moment when one morning as i stood searching the column of announcements to find the afternoon performances for the week of the new year holidays i saw there for the first time at the foot of the bill after some probably insignificant curtainraiser whose title was opaque to me because it had latent in it all the details of an action of which i was ignorant two acts ofphedre with mme berma and on the following afternoons le demimonde les caprices de marianne names which like that of phedre were for me transparent filled with light only so familiar were those works to me illuminated to their very depths by the revealing smile of art they seemed to me to invest with a fresh nobility mme berma herself when i read in the newspapers after the programme of these performances that it was she who had decided to shew herself once more to the public in some of her early creations she was conscious then that certain stageparts have an interest which survives the novelty of their first production or the success of a revival she regarded them when interpreted by herself as museum pieces which it might be instructive to set before the eyes of the generation which had admired her in them long ago or of that which had never yet seen her in them in thus advertising in the middle of a column of plays intended only to while away an evening this phedre a title no longer than any of the rest nor set in different type she added something indescribable as though a hostess introducing you before you all go in to dinner to her other guests were to mention casually amid the string of names which are the names of guests and nothing more and without any change of tonem anatole france the doctor who was attending me the same who had forbidden me to travel advised my parents not to let me go to the theatre i should only be ill again afterwards perhaps for weeks and should in the long run derive more pain than pleasure from the experience the fear of this might have availed to stop me if what i had anticipated from such a spectacle had been only a pleasure for which a subsequent pain could so compensate as to cancel it but what i demanded from this performance just as from the visit to balbec the visit to venice for which i had so intensely longed was something quite different from pleasure a series of verities pertaining to a world more real than that in which i lived which once acquired could never be taken from me again by any of the trivial incidents even though it were the because of bodily suffering of my otiose existence at best the pleasure which i was to feel during the performance appeared to me as the perhaps inevitable form of the perception of these truths and i hoped only that the illness which had been forecast for me would not begin until the play was finished so that my pleasure should not be in any way compromised or spoiled i implored my parents who after the doctors visit were no longer inclined to let me go to phedre i repeated all day long to myself the speech beginning on dit quun prompt départ vous éloigne de nous seeking out every intonation that could be put into it so as to be able better to measure my surprise at the way which berma would have found of uttering the lines concealed like the holy of holies beneath the veil that screened her from my gaze behind which i invested her every moment with a fresh aspect according to which of the words of bergotte in the pamphlet that gilberte had found for me was passing through my mind plastic nobility christian austerity or jansenist pallor princess of troezen and of cleves or mycenean drama delphic symbol solar myth that divine beauty whom bermas acting was to reveal to me night and day upon an altar perpetually illumined sat enthroned hi the sanctuary of my mind my mind for which not itself but my stern my fickle parents were to decide whether or not it was to enshrine and for all time the perfections of the deity unveiled in the same spot where was now her invisible form and with my eyes fixed upon that inconceivable image i strove from morning to night to overcome the barriers which my family were putting in my way but when those had at last fallen when my mother albeit this matinée was actually to coincide with the meeting of the commission from which my father had promised to bring m de norpois home to dinner had said to me very well we do not wish you to be unhappy if you think that you will enjoy it so very much you must go that is all when this day of theatregoing hitherto forbidden and unattainable depended now only upon myself then for the first time being no longer troubled by the wish that it might cease to be impossible i asked myself if it were desirable if there were not other reasons than my parents prohibition which should make me abandon my design in the first place whereas i had been detesting them for their cruelty their consent made them now so dear to me that the thought of causing them pain stabbed me also with a pain through which the purpose of life shewed itself as the pursuit not of truth but of lovingkindness and life itself seemed good or evil only as my parents were happy or sad i would rather not go if it hurts you i told my mother who on the contrary strove hard to expel from my mind any lurking fear that she might regret my going since that she said would spoil the pleasure that i should otherwise derive fromphedre and it was the thought of my pleasure that had induced my father and her to re their earlier decision but then this sort of obligation to find a pleasure in the performance seemed to me very burdensome besides if i returned home ill should i be well again in time to be able to go to the champselysées as soon as the holidays were over and gilberte returned against all these arguments i set so as to decide which course i should take the idea invisible there behind its veil of the perfections of berma i cast into one pan of the scales making mamma unhappy risking not being able to go on the champselysées and the other jansenist pallor solar myth until the words themselves grew dark and clouded in my minds vision ceased to say anything to me lost all their force and gradually my hesitations became so painful that if i had now decided upon the theatre it would have been only that i might bring them to an end and be delivered from them once and for all it would have been to fix a term to my sufferings and no longer in the expectation of an intellectual benediction yielding to the attractions of perfection that i would let myself be taken not now to the wise goddess but to the stern implacable divinity featureless and unnamed who had been secretly substituted for her behind the veil but suddenly everything was altered my desire to go and hear berma received a fresh stimulus which enabled me to await the coming of the matinée with impatience and with joy having gone to take up in front of the column on which the playbills were my daily station as excruciating of late as that of a stylite saint i had seen there still moist and wrinkled the complete bill of phedre which had just been pasted up for the first time and on which i must confess the rest of the cast furnished no additional attraction which could help me to decide but it gave to one of the points between which my indecision wavered a form at once more concrete and inasmuch as the bill was dated not from the day on which i read it but from that on which the performance would take place and from the very hour at which the curtain would rise almost imminent well on the way already to its realisation so that i jumped for joy before the column at the thought that on that day and at that hour precisely i should be sitting there in my place ready to hear the voice of berma and for fear lest my parents might not now be in time to secure two good seats for my grandmother and myself i raced back to the house whipped on by the magic words which had now taken the place in my mind of jansenist pallor and solar myth ladies will not be admitted to the stalls in hats the doors will be closed at two of the clock you might also like alas that first matinée was to prove a bitter disappointment my father offered to drop my grandmother and me at the theatre on his way to the commission before leaving the house he said to my mother see that you have a good dinner for us tonight you remember i am bringing de norpois back with me my mother had not forgotten and all that day and overnight françoise rejoicing in the opportunity to devote herself to that art of the kitchen of which she was indeed a pastmaster stimulated moreover by the prospect of having a new guest to feed the consciousness that she would have to compose by methods known to her alone a dish of beef in jelly had been living in the effervescence of creation since she attached the utmost importance to the intrinsic quality of the materials which were to enter into the fabric of her work she had gone herself to the halles to procure the best cuts of rumpsteak shin of beef calvesfeet as michelangelo passed eight months in the mountains of carrara choosing the most perfect blocks of marble for the monument of julius ii françoise expended on these comings and goings so much ardour that mamma at the sight of her flaming cheeks was alarmed lest our old servant should make herself ill with overwork like the sculptor of the tombs of the medici in the quarries of pietrasanta and overnight françoise had sent to be cooked in the bakers oven shielded with breadcrumbs like a block of pink marble packed in sawdust what she called a nevyork ham believing the language to be less rich than it actually was in words and her own ears less trustworthy the first time that she heard anyone mention york ham she had thought no doubt feeling it to be hardly conceivable that the dictionary could be so prodigal as to include at once a york and a new york that she had misheard what was said and that the ham was really called by the name already familiar to her and so ever since the word york was preceded in her ears or before her eyes when she read it in an advertisement by the affix new which she pronounced nev and it was with the most perfect faith that she would say to her kitchenmaid go and fetch me a ham from olidas madame told me especially to get a nevyork on that particular day if françoise was consumed by the burning certainty of creative genius my lot was the cruel anxiety of the seeker after truth no doubt so long as i had not yet heard berma speak i still felt some pleasure i felt it in the little square that lay in front of the theatre in which in two hours time the bare boughs of the chestnut trees would gleam with a metallic lustre as the lighted gaslamps shewed up every detail of their structure before the attendants in the boxoffice the selection of whom their promotion all their destiny depended upon the great artist for she alone held power in the theatre where ephemeral managers followed one after the other in an obscure succession who took our tickets without even glancing at us so preoccupied were they with their anxiety lest any of mme bermas instructions had not been duly transmitted to the new members of the staff lest it was not clearly everywhere understood that the hired applause must never sound for her that the windows must all be kept open so long as she was not on the stage and every door closed tight the moment that she appeared that a bowl of hot water must be concealed somewhere close to her to make the dust settle and for that matter at any moment now her carriage drawn by a pair of horses with flowing manes would be stopping outside the theatre she would alight from it muffled in furs and crossly acknowledging everyone is salute would send one of her attendants to find out whether a stage box had been kept for her friends what the temperature was in front who were in the other boxes if the programme sellers were looking smart theatre and public being to her no more than a second an outermost cloak which she would put on and the medium the more or less good conductor through which her talent would have to pass i was happy too in the theatre itself since i had made the discovery that in contradiction of the picture so long entertained by my childish imagination there was but one stage for everybody i had supposed that i should be prevented from seeing it properly by the presence of the other spectators as one is when in the thick of a crowd now i registered the fact that on the contrary thanks to an arrangement which is so to speak symbolical of all spectatorship everyone feels himself to be the centre of the theatre which explained to me why when françoise had been sent once to see some melodrama from the top gallery she had assured us on her return that her seat had been the best in the house and that instead of finding herself too far from the stage she had been positively frightened by the mysterious and living proximity of the curtain my pleasure increased further when i began to distinguish behind the said lowered curtain such confused rappings as one hears through the she will of an egg before the chicken emerges sounds which speedily grew louder and suddenly from that world which impenetrable by our eyes yet scrutinised us with its own addressed themselves and to us indubitably in the imperious form of three consecutive hammerblows as moving as any signals from the planet mars and once this curtain had risen when on the stage a writingtable and a fireplace in no way out of the ordinary had indicated that the persons who were about to enter would be not actors come to recite as i had seen them once and heard them at an evening party but real people just living their lives at home on whom i was thus able to spy without their seeing me my pleasure still endured it was broken by a momentary uneasiness just as i was straining my ears in readiness before the piece began two men entered the theatre from the side of the stage who must have been very angry with each other for they were talking so loud that in the auditorium where there were at least a thousand people we could hear every word whereas in quite a small café one is obliged to call the waiter and ask what it is that two men who appear to be quarrelling are saying but at that moment while i sat astonished to find that the audience was listening to them without protest drowned as it was in a universal silence upon which broke presently a laugh here and there i understood that these insolent fellows were the actors and that the short piece known as the curtainraiser had now begun it was followed by an interval so long that the audience who had returned to their places grew impatient and began to stamp their feet i was terrified at this for just as in the report of a criminal trial when i read that some nobleminded person was coming against his own interests to testify on behalf of an innocent prisoner i was always afraid that they would not be nice enough to him would not shew enough gratitude would not recompense him lavishly and that he in disgust would then range himself on the side of injustice so now attributing to genius in this respect the same qualities as to virtue i was afraid lest berma annoyed by the bad behaviour of so illbred an audience in which on the other hand i should have liked her to recognise with satisfaction a few celebrities to whose judgment she would be bound to attach importance should express her discontent and disdain by acting badly and i gazed appealingly round me at these stamping brutes who were about to shatter in their insensate rage the rare and fragile impression which i had come to seek the last moments of my pleasure were during the opening scenes of phedre the heroine herself does not appear in these first scenes of the second act and yet as soon as the curtain rose and another curtain of red velvet this time was parted in the middle a curtain which was used to halve the depth of the stage in all the plays in which the star appeared an actress entered from the back who had the face and voice which i had been told were those of berma the cast must therefore have been changed all the trouble that i had taken in studying the part of the wife of theseus was wasted but a second actress now responded to the first i must then have been mistaken in supposing that the first was berma for the second even more closely resembled her and more than the other had her diction both of them moreover enriched their parts with noble gestures which i could vividly distinguish and could appreciate in their relation to the text while they raised and let fall the lovely folds of their tunics and also with skilful changes of tone now passionate now ironical which made me realise the significance of lines that i had read to myself at home without paying sufficient attention to what they really meant but all of a sudden in the cleft of the red curtain that veiled her sanctuary as in a frame appeared a woman and simultaneously with the fear that seized me far more vexing than bermas fear could be lest someone should upset her by opening a window or drown one of her lines by rustling a programme or annoy her by applauding the others and by not applauding her enough in my own fashion still more absolute than bermas of considering from that moment theatre audience play and my own body only as an acoustic medium of no importance save in the degree to which it was favourable to the inflexions of that voice i realised that the two actresses whom i had been for some minutes admiring bore not the least resemblance to her whom i had come to hear but at the same time all my pleasure had ceased in vain might i strain towards bermas eyes ears mind so as not to let one morsel escape me of the reasons which she would furnish for my admiring her i did not succeed in gathering a single one i could not even as i could with her companions distinguish in her diction and in her playing intelligent intonations beautiful gestures i listened to her as though i were readingphedre or as though phaedra herself had at that moment uttered the words that i was hearing without its appearing that bermas talent had added anything at all to them i could have wished so as to be able to explore them fully so as to attempt to discover what it was in them that was beautiful to arrest to immobilise for a time before my senses every intonation of the artists voice every expression of her features at least i did attempt by dint of my mental agility in having before a line came my attention ready and tuned to catch it not to waste upon preparations any morsel of the precious time that each word each gesture occupied and thanks to the intensity of my observation to manage to penetrate as far into them as if i had had whole hours to spend upon them by myself but how short their duration was scarcely had a sound been received by my ear than it was displaced there by another in one scene where berma stands motionless for a moment her arm raised to the level of a face bathed by some piece of stagecraft in a greenish light before a backcloth painted to represent the sea the whole house broke out in applause but already the actress had moved and the picture that i should have liked to study existed no longer i told my grandmother that i could not see very well she handed me her glasses only when one believes in the reality of a thing making it visible by artificial means is not quite the same as feeling that it is close at hand i thought now that it was no longer berma at whom i was looking but her image in a magnifying glass i put the glasses down but then possibly the image that my eye received of her diminished by distance was no more exact which of the two bermas was the real as for her speech to hippolyte i had counted enormously upon that since to judge by the ingenious significance which her companions were disclosing to me at every moment in less beautiful parts she would certainly render it with intonations more surprising than any which when reading the play at home i had contrived to imagine but she did not attain to the heights which onone or aricie would naturally have reached she planed down into a uniform flow of melody the whole of a passage in which there were mingled together contradictions so striking that the least intelligent of tragic actresses even the pupils of an academy could not have missed their effect besides which she ran through the speech so rapidly that it was only when she had come to the last line that my mind became aware of the deliberate monotony which she had imposed on it throughout then at last a sense of admiration did possess me provoked by the frenzied applause of the audience i mingled my own with theirs endeavouring to prolong the general sound so that berma in her gratitude should surpass herself and i be certain of having heard her on one of her great days a curious thing by the way was that the moment when this storm of public enthusiasm broke loose was as i afterwards learned that in which berma reveals one of her richest treasures it would appear that certain transcendent realities emit all around them a radiance to which the crowd is sensitive so it is that when any great event occurs when on a distant frontier an army is in jeopardy or defeated or victorious the vague and conflicting reports which we receive from which an educated man can derive little enlightenment stimulate in the crowd an emotion by which that man is surprised and in which once expert criticism has informed him of the actual military situation he recognises the popular perception of that aura which surrounds momentous happenings and which may be visible hundreds of miles away one learns of a victory either after the war is over or at once from the hilarious joy of ones hall porter one discovers the touch of genius in bermas acting a week after one has heard her in the criticism of some review or else on the spot from the thundering acclamation of the stalls but this immediate recognition by the crowd was mingled with a hundred others all quite erroneous the applause came most often at wrong moments apart from the fact that it was mechanically produced by the effect of the applause that had gone before just as in a storm once the sea is sufficiently disturbed it will continue to swell even after the wind has begun to subside no matter the more i applauded the better it seemed to me did berma act i say came from a woman sitting near me of no great social pretensions she fairly gives it you she does you would think she would do herself an injury the way she runs about i call that acting do not you and happy to find these reasons for bermas superiority though not without a suspicion that they no more accounted for it than would for that of the gioconda or of benvenutos perseus a peasants gaping that is a good bit of work it is all gold look fine are not it i greedily imbibed the strong wine of this popular enthusiasm i felt all the same when the curtain had fallen fer the last time disappointed that the pleasure for which i had so longed had been no greater but at the same time i felt the need to prolong it not to depart for ever when i left the theatre from this strange life of the stage which had for a few hours been my own from which i should be tearing myself away as though i were going into exile when i returned to my own home had i not hoped there to learn a great deal more about berma from her admirer to whom i was indebted already for the permission to go to phedre m de norpois i was introduced to him before dinner by my father who summoned me into his study for the purpose as i entered the ambassador rose held out his hand bowed his tall figure and fixed his blue eyes attentively on my face as the foreign visitors who used to be presented to him in the days when he still represented france abroad were all more or less even the famous singers persons of note with regard to whom he could tell when he met them that he would be able to say later on when he heard then names mentioned in paris or in petersburg that he remembered perfectly the evening he had spent with them at munich or sofia he had formed the habit of impressing upon them by his affability the pleasure with which he was making their acquaintance but in addition to this being convinced that in the life of european capitals in contact at once with all the interesting personalities that passed through them and with the manners and customs of the native populations one acquired a deeper insight than could be gained from books into the intellectual movement throughout europe he would exercise upon each newcomer his keen power of observation so as to decide at once with what manner of man he had to deal the government had not for some time now entrusted to him a post abroad but still as soon as anyone was introduced to him his eyes as though they had not yet been informed of their masters retirement began their fruitful observation while by his whole attitude he endeavoured to convey that the strangers name was not unknown to him and so all the time while he spoke to me kindly and with the air of importance of a man who is conscious of the vastness of his own experience he never ceased to examine me with a sagacious curiosity and to his own profit as though i had been some exotic custom some historic and instruct tive building or some star upon his course and in this way he gave proof at once in his attitude towards me of the majestic benevolence of the sage mentor and of the zealous curiosity of the young anacharsis he offered me absolutely no opening to the revue des deuxmondes but put a number of questions to me on what i had been doing and reading asked what were my own inclinations which i heard thus spoken of for the first time as though it might be a quite reasonable thing to obey their promptings whereas hitherto i had always supposed it to be my duty to suppress them since they attracted me towards literature he did not dissuade me from that course on the contrary he spoke of it with deference as of some venerable personage whose select circle in rome or at dresden one remembers with pleasure and regrets only that ones multifarious duties in life enable one to revisit it so seldom he appeared to be envying me with an almost jovial smile the delightful hours which more fortunate than himself and more free i should be able to spend with such a mistress but the very terms that he employed shewed me literature as something entirely different from the image that i had formed of it at combray and i realised that i had been doubly right in abandoning my intention until now i had reckoned only that i had not the gift for writing now m de norpois took from me the ambition also i wanted to express to him what had been my dreams trembling with emotion i was painfully apprehensive that all the words which i could utter would not be the sincerest possible equivalent of what i had felt what i had never yet attempted to formulate that is to say that my words had no clear significance perhaps by a professional habit perhaps by virtue of the calm that is acquired by every important personage whose advice is commonly sought and who knowing that he will keep the control of the conversation in his own hands allows the other party to fret to struggle to take his time perhaps also to emphasize the dignity of his head greek according to himself despite his sweeping whiskers m de norpois while anything was being explained to him would preserve a facial immobility as absolute as if you had been addressing some ancient and unhearing bust in a museum until suddenly falling upon you like an auctioneers hammer or a delphic oracle the ambassadors voice as he replied to you would be all the more impressive in that nothing in his face had allowed you to guess what sort of impression you had made on him or what opinion he was about to express precisely he suddenly began as though the case were now heard and judged and after allowing me to writhe in increasing helplessness beneath those motionless eyes which never for an instant left my face there is the case of the son of one of my friends which mutatis mutandis is very much like yours he adopted in speaking of our common tendency the same reassuring tone as if it had been a tendency not to literature but to rheumatics and he had wished to assure me that it would not necessarily prove fatal he too has chosen to leave the quai dorsay although the way had been paved for him there by his father and without caring what people might say he has settled down to write and certainly he is had no reason to regret it he published two years ago of course he is much older than you you understand a book dealing with the sense of the infinite on the western shore of victoria nyanza and this year he has brought out a little thing not so important as the other but very brightly in places perhaps almost too pointedly written on the repeating rifle in the bulgarian army and these have put him quite in a class by himself he is gone pretty far already and he is not the sort of man to stop half way i happen to know that without any suggestion of course of his standing for election his name has been mentioned several times in conversation and not at all unfavourably at the academy of moral sciences and so one cannot say yet of course that he has reached the pinnacle of fame still he has made his way by sheer industry to a very fine position indeed and success which does not always come only to agitators and mischiefmakers and men who make trouble which is usually more than they are prepared to take success has crowned his efforts my father seeing me already in a few years time an academician was tasting a contentment which m de norpois raised to the supreme pitch when after a momentary hesitation in which he appeared to be calculating the possible consequences of so rash an act he handed me his card and said why not go and see him yourself tell him i sent you he may be able to give you some good advice plunging me by his words into as painful a state of anxiety as if he had told me that next morning i was to embark as cabinboy on board a sailing ship and to go round the world my aunt léonie had bequeathed to me together with all sorts of other things and much of her furniture with which it was difficult to know what to do almost all her unsettled estate revealing thus after her death an affection for me which i had hardly suspected in her lifetime my father who was trustee of this estate until i came of age now consulted m de norpois with regard to several of the investments he recommended certain stocks bearing a low rate of interest which he considered particularly sound notably english consols and russian four per cents with absolutely first class securities such as those said m de norpois even if your income from them is nothing very great you may be certain of never losing any of your capital my father then told him roughly what else he had bought m de norpois gave a just perceptible smile of congratulation like all capitalists he regarded wealth as an enviable thing but thought it more delicate to compliment people upon their possessions only by a halfindicated sign of intelligent sympathy on the other hand as he was himself immensely rich he felt that he shewed his good taste by seeming to regard as considerable the meagre revenues of his friends with a happy and comforting resilience to the superiority of his own he made amends for this by congratulating my father without hesitation on the composition of his list of investments selected with so sure so delicate so fine a taste you would have supposed to hear him that he attributed to the relative values of investments and even to investments themselves something akin to aesthetic merit of one comparatively recent and still little known which my father mentioned m de norpois like the people who have always read the books of which you imagine you yourself alone have ever heard said at once ah yes i used to amuse myself for some time with watching it in the papers it was quite interesting with the retrospective smile of a regular subscriber who has read the latest novel already in monthly instalments in his magazine it would not be at all a bad idea to apply for some of this new issue it is distinctly attractive they are offering it at a most tempting discount but when he came to some of the older investments my father who could not remember their exact names which it was easy to confuse with others of the same kind opened a drawer and shewed the securities themselves to the ambassador the sight of them enchanted me they were ornamented with cathedral spires and allegorical figures like the old romantic editions that i had pored over as a child all the products of one period have something in common the artists who illustrate the poetry of their generation are the same artists who are employed by the big financial houses and nothing reminds me so much of the monthly parts of notredame de paris and of various books by gérard de nerval that used to hang outside the grocers door at combray than does in its rectangular and flowery border supported by recumbent rivergods a personal share in the water company the contempt which my father had for my kind of intelligence was so far tempered by his natural affection for me that in practice his attitude towards anything that i might do was one of blind indulgence and so he had no qualm about telling me to fetch a little prose poem which i had made up years before at combray while coming home from a walk i had written it down in a state of exaltation which must i felt certain infect everyone who read it but it was not destined to captivate m de norpois for he handed it back to me without a word my mother who had the most profound respect for all my fathers occupations came in now timidly to ask whether dinner might be served she was afraid to interrupt a conversation in which she herself could have no part and indeed my father was continually reminding the marquis of some useful suggestion which they had decided to make at the next meeting of the commission speaking in the peculiar tone always adopted when in a strange environment by a pair of colleagues as exclusive in this respect as two young men from the same college whose professional routine has furnished them with a common fund of memories to which the others present have no access and to which they are unwilling to refer before an audience but the absolute control over his facial muscles to which m de norpois had attained allowed him to listen without seeming to hear a word at last my father became uneasy i had thought he ventured after an endless preamble of asking the advice of the commission then from the face of the noble virtuoso who had been sitting inert as a player in an orchestra sits until the moment comes for him to begin his part were uttered with an even delivery on a sharp note and as though they were no more than the completion but scored for a different voice of the phrase that my father had begun the words of which you will not hesitate of course to call a meeting more especially as the present members are all known to you personally and there may be a change any day this was not in itself a very remarkable ending but the immobility that had preceded it made it detach itself with the crystal clarity the almost malicious unexpectedness of those phrases in which the piano silent until thentakes up at a given moment the violoncello to which one has just been listening in a mozart concerto well did you enjoy your matinée asked my father as we moved to the diningroom meaning me to shew off and with the idea that my enthusiasm would give m de norpois a good opinion of me he has just been to hear berma you remember we were talking about it the other day he went on turning towards the diplomat in the same tone of retrospective technical mysterious allusiveness as if he had been referring to a meeting of the commission you must have been enchanted especially if you had never heard her before your father was alarmed at the effect that the little jaunt might have upon your health which is none too good i am told none too robust but i soon set his mind at rest theatres today are not what they were even twenty years ago you have more or less comfortable seats now and a certain amount of ventilation although we have still a long way to go before we come up to germany or england which in that respect as in many others are immeasurably ahead of us i have never seen mme berma in phedre but i have always heard that she is excellent in the part you were charmed with her of course m de norpois a man a thousand times more intelligent than myself must know that hidden truth which i had failed to extract from bermas playing he knew and would reveal it to me in answering his question i would implore him to let me know in what that truth consisted and he would tell me and so justify me in the longing that i had felt to see and hear the actress i had only a moment i must make what use i could of it and bring my crossexamination to bear upon the essential points but what were they fastening my whole attention upon my own so confused impressions with no thought of making m de norpois admire me but only that of learning from him the truth that i had still to discover i made no attempt to substitute readymade phrases for the words that failed me i stood there stammering until finally in the hope of provoking him into declaring what there was in berma that was admirable i confessed that i had been disappointed what is that cried my father annoyed at the bad impression which this admission of my failure to appreciate the performance must make on m de norpois what on earth do you mean you did not enjoy it why your grandmother has been telling us that you sat there hanging on every word that berma uttered with your eyes starting out of your head that everyone else in the theatre seemed quite bored beside you oh yes i was listening as hard as i could trying to find out what it was that was supposed to be so wonderful about her of course she is frightfully good and all that if she is frightfully good what more do you want one of the things that have undoubtedly contributed to the success of mme berma resumed m de norpois turning with elaborate courtesy towards my mother so as not to let her be left out of the conversation and in conscientious fulfilment of his duty of politeness to the lady of the house is the perfect taste that she shews in selecting her parts thus she can always be assured of success and success of the right sort she hardly ever appears in anything trivial look how she has thrown herself into the part of phedre and then she brings the same good taste to the choice of her costumes and to her acting in spite of her frequent and lucrative tours in england and america the vulgarity i will not say of john bull that would be unjust at any rate to the england of the victorian era but of uncle sam has not infected her no loud colours no rant and then that admirable voice which has been of such service to her with which she plays so delightfully i should almost be tempted to describe it as a musical instrument my interest in bermas acting had continued to grow ever since the fall of the curtain because it was then no longer compressed within the limits of reality but i felt the need to find explanations for it moreover it had been fixed with the same intensity while berma was on the stage upon everything that she offered in the indivisibility of a living whole to my eyes and ears there was nothing separate or distinct it welcomed accordingly the discovery of a reasonable because in these tributes paid to the simplicity to the good taste of the actress it attracted them to itself by its power of absorption seized hold of them as the optimism of a drunken man seizes hold of the actions of his neighbour in each of which he finds an excuse for emotion he is right i told myself what a charming voice what an absence of shrillness what simple costumes what intelligence to have chosen phedre no i have not been disappointed the cold beef spiced with carrots made its appearance couched by the michelangelo of our kitchen upon enormous crystals of jelly like transparent blocks of quartz you have a chef of the first order madame said m de norpois and that is no small matter i myself who have had when abroad to maintain a certain style in housekeeping i know how difficult it often is to find a perfect mastercook but this is a positive banquet that you have set before us and indeed françoise in the excitement of her ambition to make a success for so distinguished a guest of a dinner the preparation of which had been obstructed by difficulties worthy of her powers had given herself such trouble as she no longer took when we were alone and had recaptured her incomparable combray manner that is a thing you cannot get in a chophouse in the best of them i mean a spiced beef in which the jelly does not taste of glue and the beef has caught the flavour of the carrots it is admirable allow me to come again he went on making a sign to shew that he wanted more of the jelly i should be interested to see how your vatel managed a dish of quite a different kind i should like for instance to see him tackle a boeuf stroganoff m de norpois so as to add his own contribution to the gaiety of the repast entertained us with a number of the stories with which he was in the habit of regaling his colleagues in the career quoting now some ludicrous sentence uttered by a politician an old offender whose sentences were always long and packed with incoherent images now some monumental epigram of a diplomat sparkling with attic salt but to tell the truth the criterion which for him set apart these two kinds of phrase in no way resembled that which i was in the habit of applying to literature most of the finer shades escaped me the words which he repeated with derision seemed to me not to differ very greatly from those which he found remarkable he belonged to the class of men who had we come to discuss the books that i liked would have said so you understand that do you i must confess that i do not understand i am not initiated but i could have matched his attitude for i did not grasp the wit or folly the eloquence or pomposity which he found in a statement or a speech and the absence of any perceptible reason for ones being badly and the others well expressed made that sort of literature seem more mysterious more obscure to me than any other i could distinguish only that to repeat what everybody else was thinking was in politics the mark not of an inferior but of a superior mind when m de norpois made use of certain expressions which were common form in the newspapers and uttered them with emphasis one felt that they became an official pronouncement by the mere fact of his having employed them and a pronouncement which would provoke a string of comment my mother was counting greatly upon the pineapple and truffle salad but the ambassador after fastening for a moment on the confection the penetrating gaze of a trained observer ate it with the inscrutable discretion of a diplomat and without disclosing to us what he thought of it my mother insisted upon his taking some more which he did but saying only in place of the compliment for which she was hoping i obey madame for i can see that it is on your part a positive ukase we saw in the papers that you had a long talk with king theodosius my father ventured why yes the king who has a wonderful memory for faces was kind enough to remember when he noticed me in the stalls that i had had the honour to meet him on several occasions at the court of bavaria at a time when he had never dreamed of his oriental throne to which as you know he was summoned by a european congress and indeed had grave doubts about accepting the invitation regarding that particular sovereignty as unworthy of his race the noblest heraldically speaking in the whole of europe an aidedecamp came down to bid me pay my respects to his majesty whose command i hastened naturally to obey and i trust you are satisfied with the results of his visit enchanted one was justified in feeling some apprehension as to the manner in which a sovereign who is still so young would handle a situation requiring tact particularly at this highly delicate juncture for my own part i reposed entire confidence in the kings political sense but i must confess that he far surpassed my expectations the speech that he made at the elysée which according to information that has come to me from a most authoritative source was composed from beginning to end by himself was fully deserving of the interest that it has aroused in all quarters it was simply masterly a trifle daring i quite admit but with an audacity which after all has been fully justified by the event traditional diplomacy is all very well in its way but in practice it has made his country and ours live in an hermetically sealed atmosphere in which it was no longer possible to breathe very well there is one method of letting in fresh air obviously not one of the methods which one could officially recommend but one which king theodosius might allow himself to adopt and that is to break the windows which he accordingly did with a spontaneous good humour that delighted everybody and also with an aptness in his choice of words in which one could at once detect the race of scholarly princes from whom he is descended through his mother there can be no question that when he spoke of the affinities that bound his country to france the expression rarely as it may occur in the vocabulary of the chancellories was a singularly happy one you see that literary ability is no drawback even in diplomacy even upon a throne he went on turning for a moment to myself the community of interests had long been apparent i quite admit and the relations of the two powers were excellent still it needed putting into words the word was what we were all waiting for it was chosen with marvellous aptitude you have seen the effect it had for my part i must confess i applauded openly your friend m de vaugoubert will be pleased after preparing for the agreement all these years all the more so that his majesty who is quite incorrigible really in some ways had taken care to spring it on him as a surprise and it did come as a complete surprise incidentally to everyone concerned beginning with the foreign minister himself who i have heard did not find it at all to his liking it appears that someone spoke to him about it and that he replied pretty sharply and loud enough to be overheard by the people on either side of them i have been neither consulted nor informed indicating clearly by that that he declined to accept any responsibility for the consequences i must own that the incident has given rise to a great deal of comment and i should not go so far as to deny he went on with a malicious smile that certain of my colleagues for whom the supreme law appears to be that of inertia may have been shaken from their habitual repose as for vaugoubert you are aware that he has been bitterly attacked for his policy of bringing that country into closer relations with france which must have been more than ordinarily painful to him he is so sensitive such an exquisite nature i can amply testify to that since for all that he is considerably my junior i have had many dealings with him we are friends of long standing and i know him intimately besides who could help knowing him his is a heart of crystal indeed that is the one fault that there is to be found with him it is not necessary for the heart of a diplomat to be as transparent as all that still that does not prevent their talking of sending him to rome which would be a fine rise for him but a pretty big plum to swallow between ourselves i fancy that vaugoubert utterly devoid of ambition as he is would be very well pleased and would by no means ask for that cup to pass from him for all we know he may do wonders down there he is the chosen candidate of the consulta and for my part i can see him very well placed with his artistic leanings in the setting of the farnese palace and the caracci gallery at least you would suppose that it was impossible for any one to hate him but there is a whole camarilla collected round king theodosius which is more or less held in fief by the wilhelmstrasse whose inspiration its members dutifully absorb and these men have done everything in their power to checkmate him not only has vaugoubert had to face these backstairs intrigues he has had to endure also the insults of a gang of hireling pamphleteers who later on being like every subsidised journalist the most arrant cowards have been the first to cry quits but in the interval had not shrunk from hurling at our representative the most fatuous accusations that the wit of irresponsible fools could invent for a month and more vaugouberts enemies had been dancing round him howling for his scalp m de norpois detached this word with shacp emphasis but forewarned is forearmed as for their insults he spurned them with his foot he went on with even more determination and with so fierce a glare in his eye that for a moment we forgot our food in the words of a fine arab proverb the dogs may bark the caravan goes on after launching this quotation m de norpois paused and examined our faces to see what effect it had had upon us its effect was great the proverb being familiar to us already it had taken the place that year among people who really counted of he who sows the wind shall reap the whirlwind which was sorely in need of a rest not having the perennial freshness of working for the king of prussia for the culture of these eminent men was an alternate if not a tripartite and triennial culture of course the use of quotations such as these with which m de norpois excelled in jewelling his articles in the revue was in no way essential to their appearing solid and wellinformed even without the ornament which the quotations supplied it sufficed that m de norpois should write at a given point as he never failed to write the court of st jamess was not the last to be sensible of the peril or feeling ran high on the singers bridge which with anxious eyes was following the selfish but skilful policy of the dual monarchy or a cry of alarm sounded from montecitorio or yet again that everlasting doubledealing which is so characteristic of the ballplatz by these expressions the profane reader had at once recognised and had paid deference to the diplomat de carriere but what had made people say that he was something more than that that he was endowed with a superior culture had been his careful use of quotations the perfect example of which at that date was still give me a good policy and i will give you good finances to quote the favourite words of baron louis for we had not yet imported from the far east victory is on the side that can hold out a quarter of an hour longer than the otheras the japanese say this reputation for immense literary gifts combined with a positive genius for intrigue which he kept concealed beneath a mask of indifference had secured the election of m de norpois to the académie des sciences morales and there were some who even thought that he would riot be out of place in the académie française on the famous day when wishing to indicate that it was only by drawing the russian alliance closer that we could hope to arrive at an understanding with great britain he had not hesitated to write be it clearly understood in the quai dorsay be it taught henceforward in all the manuals of geography which appear to be incomplete in this respect be his certificate of graduation remorselessly withheld from every candidate who has not learned to say if all roads lead to rome nevertheless the way from paris to london runs of necessity through st petersburg in short m de norpois went on addressing my father vaugoubert has won himself considerable distinction from this affair quite beyond anything on which he can have reckoned he expected you understand a correctly worded speech which after the stormclouds of recent years would have been something to the good but nothing more several persons who had the honour to be present have assured me that it is impossible when one merely reads the speech to form any conception of the effect that it produced when uttered when articulated with marvellous clearness of diction by the king who is a master of the art of public speaking and in that passage underlined every possible shade of meaning i allowed myself in this connexion to listen to a little anecdote which brings into prominence once again that frank boyish charm by which king theodosius has won so many hearts i am assured that just as he uttered that word affinities which was of course the startling innovation of the speech and one that as you will see will provoke discussion in the chancellories for years to come his majesty anticipating the delight of our ambassador who was to find in that word the seal the crown set upon all his labours on his dreams one might almost say and in a word his marshals baton made a half turn towards vaugoubert and fixing upon him his arresting gaze so characteristic of the oettingens fired at him that admirably chosen word affinities a positive treasuretrove uttering it in a tone which made it plain to all his hearers that it was employed of set purpose and with full knowledge of the circumstances it appears that vaugoubert found some difficulty in mastering his emotion and i must confess that to a certain extent i can well understand it indeed a person who is entirely to be believed has told me in confidence that the king came up to vaugoubert after the dinner when his majesty was holding an informal court and was heard to say well are you satisfied with your pupil my dear marquis one thing however m de norpois concluded is certain and that is that a speech like that has done more than twenty years of negotiation towards bringing the two countries together uniting their affinities to borrow the picturesque expression of theodosius ii it is no more than a word if you like but look what success it has had how the whole of the european press is repeating it what interest it has aroused what a new note it has struck besides it is distinctly in the young sovereigns manner i will not go so far as to say that he lights upon a diamond of that water every day but it is very seldom that in his prepared speeches or better still in the impulsive flow of his conversation he does not reveal his character i was on the point of saying does not affix his signature by the use of some incisive word i myself am quite free from any suspicion of partiality in this respect for i am stoutly opposed to all innovations in terminology nine times out of ten they are most dangerous yes i was thinking only the other day that the german emperors telegram could not be much to your liking said my father m de norpois raised his eyes to heaven as who should say oh that fellow before he replied in the first place it is an act of ingratitude it is more than a crime it is a blunder and one of a crassness which i can describe only as pyramidal indeed unless some one puts a check on his activities the man who has got rid of bismarck is quite capable of repudiating by degrees the whole of the bismarckian policy after which it will be a leap in the dark my husband tells me sir that you are perhaps going to take him to spain one summer that will be nice for him i am so glad why yes it is an idea that greatly attracts me i amuse myself planning a tour i should like to go there with you my dear fellow but what about you madame have you decided yet how you are going to spend your holidays i shall perhaps go with my son to balbec but i am not certain oh but balbec is quite charming i was down that way a few years ago they are beginning to build some very pretty littlevillas there i think you will like the place but may i ask what has made you choose balbec my son is very anxious to visit some of the churches in that neighbourhood and balbec church in particular i was a little afraid that the tiring journey there and the discomfort of staying in the place might be too much for him but i hear that they have just opened an excellent hotel in which he will be able to get all the comfort that he requires indeed i must make a note of that for a certain person who will not turn up her nose at a comfortable hotel the church at balbec is very beautiful sir is it not i inquired repressing my sorrow at learning that one of the attractions of balbec consisted in its pretty little villas no it is not bad but it cannot be compared for a moment with such positive jewels in stone as the cathedrals of rheims and chartres or with what is to my mind the pearl among them all the saintechapelle here in paris but surely balbec church is partly romanesque is it not why yes it is in the romanesque style which is to say very cold and lifeless with no hint in it anywhere of the grace the fantasy of the later gothic builders who worked their stone as if it had been so much lace balbec church is well worth a visit if you are in those parts it is decidedly quaint on a wet day when you have nothing better to do you might look inside you will see the tomb of tourville tell me were you at the foreign ministry dinner last night asked my father i could not go no m de norpois smiled i must confess that i renounced it for a party of a very different sort i was dining with a lady whose name you may possibly have heard the beautiful mme swann my mother checked an impulsive movement for being more rapid in perception than my father she used to alarm herself on his account over things which only began to upset him a moment later anything unpleasant that might occur to him was discovered first by her just as bad news from france is always known abroad sooner than among ourselves but she was curious to know what sort of people the swanns managed to entertain and so inquired of m de norpois as to whom he had met there why my dear lady it is a house which or so it struck me is especially attractive to gentlemen there were several married men there last night but their wives were all as it happened unwell and so had not come with them replied the ambassador with a mordancy sheathed in goodhumour casting on each of us a glance the gentleness and discretion of which appeared to be tempering while in reality they deftly intensified its malice in all fairness he went on i must add that women do go to the house but women who belong rather what shall i say to the republican world than to swanns he pronounced it svanns circle still you can never tell perhaps it will turn into a political or a literary salon some day anyhow they appear to be quite happy as they are indeed i feel that swann advertises his happiness just a trifle too blatantly he told us the names of all the people who had asked him and his wife out for the next week people with whom there was no particular reason to be proud of being intimate with a want of reserve of taste almost of tact which i was astonished to remark in so refined a man he kept on repeating we have not a free evening as though that had been a thing to boast of positively like a parvenu and he is certainly not that for swann had always plenty of friends women as well as men and without seeming overbold without the least wish to appear indiscreet i think i may safely say that not all of them of course nor even the majority of them but one at least who is a lady of the very highest rank would perhaps not have shewn herself inexorably a from the idea of entering upon relations with mme swann in which case it is safe to assume that more than one sheep of the social flock would have followed her lead but it seems that there has been no indication on swanns part of any movement in that direction what do i see a nesselrode pudding as well i declare i shall need a course at carlsbad after such a lucullusfeast as this possibly swann felt that there would be too much resistance to overcome the marriage so much is certain was not well received there has been some talk of his wifes having money but that is all humbug anyhow the whole affair has been looked upon with disfavour and then swann has an aunt who is excessively rich and in an admirable position socially married to a man who financially speaking is a power not only has she refused to meet mme swann she has actually started a campaign to force her friends and acquaintances to do the same i do not mean to say that anyone who moves in a good circle in paris has shewn any actual incivility to mme swann no a hundred times no quite apart from her husbands being eminently a man to take up the challenge anyhow there is one curious thing about it to see the immense importance that swann who knows so many and such exclusive people attaches to a society of which the best that can be said is that it is extremely mixed i myself who knew him in the old days must admit that i felt more astonished than amused at seeing a man so wellbred as he is so much at home in the best houses effusively thanking the chief secretary to the minister of posts for having come to them and asking him whether mme swann might take the liberty of calling upon his wife he must feel something of an exile do not you know evidently it is quite a different world i do not think all the same that swann is unhappy it is true that for some years before the marriage she was always trying to blackmail him in a rather disgraceful way she would take the child away whenever swann refused her anything poor swann who is as unsophisticated as he is for all that sharp believed every time that the childs disappearance was a coincidence and declined to face the facts apart from that she made such continual scenes that everyone expected that from the day she attained her object and was safely married nothing could possibly restrain her and that their life would be a hell on earth instead of which just the opposite has happened people are inclined to laugh at the way in which swann speaks of his wife it is become a standing joke of course one could hardly expect that conscious more or less of being a you remember molieres line he would go and proclaim it urbi et orbi still that does not prevent one from finding a tendency in him to exaggerate when he declares that she makes an excellent wife and yet that is not so far from the truth as people imagine in her own way which is not perhaps what all husbands would prefer but then between you and me i find it difficult to believe that swann who has known her for ever so long and is far from being an utter fool did not know what to expect there can be no denying that she does seem to have a certain regard for him i do not say that she is not flighty and swann himself has no fault to find with her for that if one is to believe the charitable tongues which as you may suppose continue to wag but she is distinctly grateful to him for what he has done for her and despite the fears that were everywhere expressed of the contrary her temper seems to have become angelic this alteration was perhaps not so extraordinary as m de norpois professed to find it odette had not believed that swann would ever consent to marry her each time that she made the suggestive announcement that some man about town had just married his mistress she had seen him stiffen into a glacial silence or at the most if she were directly to challenge him asking do not you think it very nice a very fine thing that he has done for a woman who sacrificed all her youth to him had heard him answer dryly but i do not say that there is anything wrong in it everyone does what he himself thinks right she came very near indeed to believing that as he used to threaten in moments of anger he was going to leave her altogether for she had heard it said not long since by a woman sculptor that you cannot be surprised at anything men do they are such brutes and impressed by the profundity of this maxim of pessimism she had appropriated it for herself and repeated it on every possible occasion with an air of disappointment which seemed to imply after all it is not impossible in any way it would be just my luck meanwhile all the virtue had gone from the optimistic maxim which had hitherto guided odette through life you can do anything with men when they are in love with you they are such idiots a doctrine which was expressed on her face by the same tremor of an eyelid that might have accompanied such words as do not be frightened he will not break anything while she waited odette was tormented by the thought of what one of her friends who had been married by a man who had not lived with her for nearly so long as odette herself had lived with swann and had had no child by him and who was now in a definitely respectable position invited to the balls at the elysée and so forth must think of swanns behaviour a consultant more discerning than m de norpois would doubtless have been able to diagnose that it was this feeling of shame and humiliation that had embittered odette that the devilish characteristics which she displayed were no essential part of her no irremediable evil and so would easily have foretold what had indeed come to pass namely that a new rule of life the matrimonial would put an end with almost magic swiftness to these painful incidents of daily occurrence but in no sense organic practically everyone was surprised at the marriage and this in itself is surprising no doubt very few people understand the purely subjective nature of the phenomenon that we call love or how it creates so to speak a fresh a third a supplementary person distinct from the person whom the world knows by the same name a person most of whose constituent elements are derived from ourself the lover and so there are very few who can regard as natural the enormous proportions that a creature comes to assume in our eyes who is not the same as the creature that they see it would appear none the less that so far as odette was concerned people might have taken into account the fact that if indeed she had never entirely understood swanns mentality at least she was acquainted with the titles and with all the details of his studies so much so that the name of vermeer was as familiar to her as that of her own dressmaker while as for swann himself she knew intimately those traits of character of which the rest of the world must remain ignorant or merely laugh at them and only a mistress or a sister may gain possession of the revealing cherished image and so strongly are we attached to such eccentricities even to those of them which we are most anxious to correct that it is because a woman comes in time to acquire an indulgent an affectionately mocking familiarity such as we ourselves have with them or our relatives have that amours of long standing have something of the sweetness and strength of family affection the bonds that unite us to another creature receive their consecration when that creature adopts the same point of view as ourself in judging one of our imperfections and among these special traits there were others besides which belonged as much to his intellect as to his character which all the same because they had their roots in the latter odette had been able more easily to discern she complained that when swann turned author when he published his essays these characteristics were not to be found in them as they were in his letters or in his conversation where they abounded she urged him to give them a more prominent place she would have liked that because it was these things that she herself preferred in him but since she preferred them because they were the things most typical of himself she was perhaps not wrong in wishing that they might be found in his writings perhaps also she thought that his work if endowed with more vitality so that it ultimately brought him success might enable her also to form what at the verdurins she had been taught to value above everything else in the world a salon among the people to whom this sort of marriage appeared ridiculous people who in their own case would ask themselves what will m de guermantes think what will bréauté say when i marry mlle de montmorency among the people who cherished that sort of social ideal would have figured twenty years earlier swann himself the swarm who had taken endless pains to get himself elected to the jockey club and had reckoned at that time on making a brilliant marriage which by consolidating his position would have made him one of the most conspicuous figures in paris only the visions which a marriage like that suggests to the mind of the interested party need like all visions if they are not to fade away and be altogether lost to receive sustenance from without your most ardent longing is to humiliate the man who has insulted you but if you never hear of him again having removed to some other place your enemy will come to have no longer the slightest importance for you if one has lost sight for a score of years of all the people on whose account one would have liked to be elected to the jockey club or the institute the prospect of becoming a member of one or other of those corporations will have ceased to tempt one now fully as much as retirement illhealth or religious conversion protracted relations with a woman will substitute fresh visions for the old there was not on swanns part when he married odette any renunciation of his social ambitions for from these ambitions odette had long ago in the spiritual sense of the word detached him besides had he not been so detached his marriage would have been all the more creditable it is because they imply the sacrifice of a more or less advantageous position to a purely private happiness that as a general rule impossible marriages are the happiest of all one cannot very well include among the impossible marriages those that are made for money there being no instance on record of a couple of whom the wife or even the husband has thus sold himself who have not sooner or later been admitted into society if only by tradition and on the strength of so many precedents and so as not to have two conflicting standards perhaps on the other hand the artistic if not the per side of swanns nature would in any event have derived a certain amount of pleasure from coupling with himself in one of those crossings of species such as mendelians practise and mythology records a creature of a different race archduchess or prostitute from contracting a royal alliance or from marrying beneath him there had been but one person in all the world whose opinion he took into consideration whenever he thought of his possible marriage with odette that was and from no snobbish motive the duchesse de guermantes with whom odette on the contrary was but little concerned thinking only of those people whose position was immediately above her own rather than in so vague an empyrean but when swann in his daydreams saw odette as already his wife he invariably formed a picture of the moment in which he would take her her and above all her daughter to call upon the princesse des laumes who was shortly on the death of her fatherinlaw to become duchesse de guermantes he had no desire to introduce them anywhere else but his heart would soften as he invented uttering their actual words to himself all the things that the duchess would say of him to odette and odette to the duchess the affection that she would shew for gilberte spoiling her making him proud of his child he enacted to himself the scene of this introduction with the same precision in each of its imaginary details that people shew when they consider how they would spend supposing they were to win it a lottery prize the amount of which they have arbitrarily determined in so far as a mental picture which accompanies one of our resolutions may be said to be its motive so it might be said that if swann married odette it was in order to present her and gilberte without anyones else being present without if need be anyones else ever coming to know of it to the duchesse de guermantes we shall see how this sole social ambition that he had entertained for his wife and daughter was precisely that one the realisation of which proved to be forbidden him by a veto so absolute that swann died in the belief that the duchess would never possibly come to know them we shall see also that on the contrary the duchesse de guermantes did associate with odette and gilberte after the death of swann and doubtless he would have been wiser seeing that he could attach so much importance to so small a matter not to have formed too dark a picture of tie future in this connexion but to have consoled himself with the hope that the meeting of the ladies might indeed take place when he was no longer there to enjoy it the laborious process of causation which sooner or later will bring about every possible effect including consequently those which one had believed to be most nearly impossible naturally slow at times is rendered slower still by our impatience which in seeking to accelerate only obstructs it and by our very existence and comes to fruition only when we have ceased to desire it have ceased possibly to live was not swann conscious of this from his own experience had there not been already in his life as it were a préfiguration of what was to happen after his death a posthumous happiness in this marriage with this odette whom he had passionately loved even if she had not been pleasing to him at first sight whom he had married when he no longer loved her when the creature that in swann had so longed to live had so despaired of living all its life in company with odette when that creature was extinct i began next to speak of the comte de paris to ask whether he was not one of swanns friends for i was afraid lest the conversation should drift away from him why yes replied m de norpois turning towards me and fixing upon my modest person the azure gaze in which floated as in their vital element his immense capacity for work and his power of assimilation and upon my word he added once more addressing my father i do not think that i shall be overstepping the bounds of the respect which i have always professed for the prince although without you understand maintaining any personal relations with him which would inevitably compromise my position unofficial as that may be if i tell you of a little episode which is not without point no more than four years ago at a small railway station in one of the countries of central europe the prince happened to set eyes on mme swann naturally none of his circle ventured to ask his royal highness what he thought of her that would not have been seemly but when her name came up by chance in conversation by certain signs imperceptible if you like but quite unmistakable the prince appeared willing enough to let it be understood that his impression of her had in a word been far from unfavourable but there could have been no possibility surely of her being presented to the comte de paris inquired my father well we do not know with princes one never does know replied m de norpois the most exalted those who know best how to secure what is due to them are as often as not the last to let themselves be embarrassed by the decrees of popular opinion even by those for which there is most justification especially when it is a question of their rewarding a personal attachment to themselves now it is certain that the comte de paris has always most graciously recognised the devotion of swann who is for that matter a man of character in spite of it all and what was your own impression your excellency do tell us my mother asked from politeness as well as from curiosity all the energy of the old connoisseur broke through the habitual moderation of his speech as he answered quite excellent and knowing that the admission that a strong impression has been made on one by a woman takes its place provided that one makes it in a playful tone in a certain category of the art of conversation that is highly appreciated he broke into a little laugh that lasted for several seconds moistening the old diplomats blue eyes and making his nostrils with their network of tiny scarlet veins quiver she is altogether charming was there a writer of the name of bergotte at this dinner sir i asked timidly still trying to keep the conversation to the subject of the swanns yes bergotte was there replied m de norpois inclining his head courteously towards me as though in his desire to be pleasant to my father he attached to everything connected with him a real importance even to the questions of a boy of my age who was not accustomed to see such politeness shewn to him by persons of his do you know him he went on fastening on me that clear gaze the penetration of which had won the praise of bismarck my son does not know him but he admires his work immensely my mother explained good heavens exclaimed m de norpois inspiring me with doubts of my own intelligence far more serious than those that ordinarily distracted me when i saw that what i valued a thousand thousand times more than myself what i regarded as the most exalted thing in the world was for him at the very foot of the scale of admiration i do not share your sons point of view bergotte is what i call a fluteplayer one must admit that he plays on it very agreeably although with a great deal of mannerism of affectation but when all is said it is no more than that and that is nothing very great nowhere does one find in his enervated writings anything that could be called construction no action or very little but above all no range his books fail at the foundation or rather they have no foundation at all at a time like the present when the everincreasing complexity of life leaves one scarcely a moment for reading when the map of europe has undergone radical alterations and is on the eve very probably of undergoing others more drastic still when so many new and threatening problems are arising on every side you will allow me to suggest that one is entitled to ask that a writer should be something else than a fine intellect which makes us forget amid otiose and byzantine discussions of the merits of pure form that we may be overwhelmed at any moment by a double tide of barbarians those from without and those from within our borders i am aware that this is a blasphemy against the sacrosanct school of what these gentlemen term art for arts sake but at this period of history there are tasks more urgent than the manipulation of words in a harmonious manner not that bergottes manner is not now and then quite attractive i have no fault to find with that but taken as a whole it is all very precious very thin and has very little virility i can now understand more easily when i bear in mind your altogether excessive regard for bergotte the few lines that you shewed me just now which it would have been unfair to you not to overlook since you yourself told me in all simplicity that they were merely a childish scribbling i had indeed said so but i did not think anything of the sort for every sin there is forgiveness and especially for the sins of youth after all others as well as yourself have such sins upon their conscience and you are not the only one who has believed himself to be a poet in his day but one can see in what you have shewn me the evil influence of bergotte you will not of course be surprised when i say that there was in it none of his good qualities since he is a pastmaster in the art incidentally quite superficial of handling a certain style of which at your age you cannot have acquired even the rudiments but already there is the same fault that paradox of stringing together finesounding words and only afterwards troubling about what they mean that is putting the cart before the horse even in bergottes books all those chinese puzzles of form all these deliquescent mandarin subtleties seem to me to be quite futile given a few fireworks let off prettily enough by an author and up goes the shout of genius works of genius are not so common as all that bergotte cannot place to his credit does not carry in his baggage if i may use the expression a single novel that is at all lofty in its conception any of those books which one keeps in a special corner of ones library i do not discover one such in the whole of his work but that does not exclude the fact that with him the work is infinitely superior to the author ah there is a man who justifies the wit who insisted that one ought never to know an author except through his books it would be impossible to imagine an individual who corresponded less to his more pretentious more pompous less fitted for human society vulgar at some moments at others talking like a book and not even like one of his own but like a boring book which his to do them justice are not such is your bergotte he has the most confused mind alembicated what our ancestors called a diseur de phébus and he makes the things that he says even more unpleasant by the manner in which he says them i forget for the moment whether it is loménie or saintebeuve who tells us that vigny repelled people by the same eccentricity but bergotte has never given us a cinqmars or a cachet rouge certain pages of which are regular anthology pieces paralysed by what m de norpois had just said to me with regard to the fragment which i had submitted to him and remembering at the same time the difficulties that i experienced when i attempted to write an essay or merely to devote myself to serious thought i felt conscious once again of my intellectual nullity and that i was not born for a literary life doubtless in the old days at combray certain impressions of a very humble order or a few pages of bergotte used to plunge me into a state of musing which had appeared to me to be of great value but this state was what my poem in prose reflected there could be no doubt that m de norpois had at once grasped and had seen through the fallacy of what i had discovered to be beautiful simply by a mirage that must be entirely false since the ambassador had not been taken in by it he had shewn me on the other hand what an infinitely unimportant place was mine when i was judged from outside objectively by the bestdisposed and most intelligent of experts i felt myself to be struck speechless overwhelmed and my mind like a fluid which is without dimensions save those of the vessel that is provided for it just as it had been expanded a moment ago so as to fill all the vast capacity of genius contracted now was entirely contained in the straitened mediocrity in which m de norpois had of a sudden enclosed and sealed it our first introduction i speak of bergotte and myself he resumed turning to my father was somewhat beset with thorns which is after all only another way of saying that it was not lacking in points bergotte some years ago now paid a visit to vienna while i was ambassador there he was presented to me by the princess metternich came and wrote his name and expected to be asked to the embassy now being in a foreign country as the representative of france to which he has after all done some honour by his writings to a certain extent let us say to be quite accurate to a very slight extent i was prepared to set aside the unfavourable opinion that i hold of his private life but he was not travelling alone and he actually let it be understood that he was not to be invited without his companion i trust that i am no more of a prude than most men and being a bachelor i was perhaps in a position to throw open the doors of the embassy a little wider than if i had been married and the father of a family nevertheless i must admit that there are depths of degradation to which i should hesitate to descend while these are rendered more repulsive still by the tone not moral merely let us be quite frank and say moralising that bergotte takes up in his books where one finds nothing but perpetual and between ourselves somewhat wearisome analyses torturing scruples morbid remorse and all for the merest peccadilloes the most trivial naughtinesses as one knows from ones own experience while all the time he is shewing such an utter lack of conscience and so much cynicism in his private life to cut a long story short i evaded the responsibility the princess returned to the charge but without success so that i do not suppose that i appear exactly in the odour of sanctity to the gentleman and i am not sure how far he appreciated swanns kindness in inviting him and myself on the same evening unless of course it was he who asked for the invitation one can never tell for really he is not normal indeed that is his sole excuse and was mme swanns daughter at the dinner i asked m de norpois taking advantage to put this question of a moment in which as we all moved towards the drawingroom i could more easily conceal my emotion than would have been possible at table where i was held fast in the glare of the lamplight m de norpois appeared to be trying for a moment to remember then yes you mean a young person of fourteen or fifteen yes of course i remember now that she was introduced to me before dinner as the daughter of our amphitryon i may tell you that i saw but little of her she retired to bed early or else she went out to see a friend i forget but i can see that you are very intimate with the swann household i play with mlle swann in the champselysées and she is delightful oh so that is it is it but i assure you i thought her charming i must confess to you however that i do not believe that she will ever be anything like her mother if i may say as much without wounding you in a vital spot i prefer mlle swanns face but i admire her mother too enormously i go for walks in the bois simply in the hope of seeing her pass ah but i must tell them that they will be highly flattered while he was uttering these words and for a few seconds after he had uttered them m de norpois was still in the same position as anyone else who hearing me speak of swann as an intelligent man of his family as respectable stockbrokers of his house as a fine house imagined that i would speak just as readily of another man equally intelligent of other stockbrokers equally respectable of another house equally fine it was the moment in which a sane man who is talking to a lunatic has not yet perceived that his companion is mad m de norpois knew that there was nothing unnatural in the pleasure which one derived from looking at pretty women that it was a social convention when anyone spoke to you of a pretty woman with any fervour to pretend to think that he was in love with her and to promise to further his designs but in saying that he would speak of me to gilberte and her mother which would enable me like an olympian deity who has taken on the fluidity of a breath of wind or rather the aspect of the old greybeard whose form minerva borrows to penetrate myself unseen into mme swanns drawingroom to attract her attention to occupy her thoughts to arouse her gratitude for my admiration to appear before her as the friend of an important person to seem to her worthy to be invited by her in the future and to enter into the intimate life of her family this important person who was going to make use in my interests of the great influence which he must have with mme swann inspired in me suddenly an affection so compelling that i had difficulty in restraining myself from kissing his gentle hands white and crumpled which looked as though they had been left lying too long in water i even sketched in the air an outline of that impulsive movement but this i supposed that i alone had observed for it is difficult for any of us to calculate exactly on what scale his words or his gestures are apparent to others partly from the fear of exaggerating our own importance and also because we enlarge to enormous proportions the field over which the impressions formed by other people in the course of their lives are obliged to extend we imagine that the accessories of our speech and attitudes scarcely penetrate the consciousness still less remain in the memory of those with whom we con it is we may suppose to a prompting of this sort that criminals yield when they touch up the wording of a statement already made thinking that the new variant cannot be confronted with any existing version but it is quite possible that even in what concerns the millennial existence of the human race the philosophy of the journalist according to which everything is destined to oblivion is less true than a contrary philosophy which would predict the conservation of everything in the same newspaper in which the moralist of the paris column says to us of an event of a work of art all the more forcibly of a singer who has enjoyed her crowded hour who will remember this in ten years time overleaf does not the report of the académie des inscriptions speak often of a fact in itself of smaller importance of a poem of little merit which dates from the epoch of the pharaohs and is now known again in its entirety is it not perhaps just the same in our brief life on earth and yet some years later in a house in which m de norpois who was also calling there had seemed to me the most solid support that i could hope to find because he was the friend of my father indulgent inclined to wish us all well and besides by his profession and upbringing trained to discretion when after the ambassador had gone i was told that he had alluded to an evening long ago when he had seen the moment in which i was just going to kiss his hands not only did i colour up to the roots of my hair but i was stupefied to learn how different from all that i had believed were not only the manner in which m de norpois spoke of me but also the constituents of his memory this tittletattle enlightened me as to the incalculable proportions of absence and presence of mind of recollection and forgetfulness which go to form the human intelligence and i was as marvellously surprised as on the day on which i read for the first time in one of masperos books that we had an exact list of the sportsmen whom assurbanipal used to invite to his hunts a thousand years before the birth of christ oh sir i assured m de norpois when he told me that he would inform gilberte and her mother how much i admired them if you would do that if you would speak of me to mme swann my whole life would not be long enough for me to prove my gratitude and that life would be all at your service but i feel bound to point out to you that i do not know mme swann and that i have never been introduced to her i had added these last words from a scruple of conscience and so as not to appear to be boasting of an acquaintance which i did not possess but while i was uttering them i felt that they were already superfluous for from the beginning of my speech of thanks with its chilling ardour i had seen flitting across the face of the ambassador an expression of hesitation and dissatisfaction and in his eyes that vertical narrow slanting look like in the drawing of a solid body in perspective the receding line of one of its surfaces that look which one addresses to the invisible audience whom one has within oneself at the moment when one is saying something that ones other audience the person whom one has been addressing myself in this instance is not meant to hear i realised in a flash that these phrases which i had pronounced which feeble as they were when measured against the flood of gratitude that was coursing through me had seemed to me bound to touch m de norpois and to confirm his decision upon an intervention which would have given him so little trouble and me so much joy were perhaps out of all those that could have been chosen with diabolical malice by persons anxious to do me harm the only ones that could result in making him abandon his intention indeed when he heard me speak just as at the moment when a stranger with whom we have been exchanging quite pleasantly our impressions which we might suppose to be similar to his of the passersby whom we have agreed in regarding as vulgar reveals suddenly the pathological abyss that divides him from us by adding carelessly as he runs his hand over his pocket what a pity i have not got my revolver here i could have picked off the lot m de norpois who knew that nothing was less costly or more easy than to be commended to mme swann and taken to her house and saw that to me on the contrary such favours bore so high a price and were consequently no doubt of great difficulty thought that the desire apparently normal which i had expressed must cloak some different thought some suspect intention some preexistent fault on account of which in the certainty of displeasing mme swann no one hitherto had been willing to undertake the responsibility for conveying a message to her from me and i understood that this office was one which he would never discharge that he might see mme swann daily for years to come without ever mentioning my name he did indeed ask her a few days later for some information which i required and charged my father to convey it to me but he had not thought it his duty to tell her at whose instance he was inquiring so she would never discover that i knew m de norpois and that i hoped so greatly to be asked to her house and this was perhaps a less misfortune than i supposed for the second of these discoveries would probably not have added much to the efficacy in any event uncertain of the first in odette the idea of her own life and of her home awakened no mysterious disturbance a person who knew her who came to see her did not seem to her a fabulous creature such as he seemed to me who would have flung a stone through swanns windows if i could have written upon it that i knew m de norpois i was convinced that such a message even when transmitted in so brutal a fashion would have done far more to exalt me in the eyes of the lady of the house than it would have prejudiced her against me but even if i had been capable of understanding that the mission which m de norpois did not perform must have remained futile nay more than that might even have damaged my credit with the swanns i should not have had the courage had he shewn himself consenting to release the ambassador from it and to renounce the pleasure however fatal its consequences might prove of feeling that my name and my person were thus brought for a moment into gilbertes presence in her unknown life and home after m de norpois had gone my father cast an eye over the evening paper i dreamed once more of berma the pleasure which i had found in listening to her required to be made complete all the more because it had fallen far short of what i had promised myself and so it at once assimilated everything that was capable of giving it nourishment those merits for uir stance which m de norpois had admitted that berma possessed and which my mind had absorbed at one draught like a dry lawn when water is poured on it then my father handed me the newspaper pointing me out a paragraph which ran more or less as follows the performance of phedre given this afternoon before an enthusiastic audience which included the foremost representatives of society and the arts as well as the principal critics was for mme berma who played the heroine the occasion of a triumph as brilliant as any that she has known in the course of her phenomenal career we shall discuss more fully in a later issue this performance which is indeed an event in the history of the stage for the present we need only add that the best qualified judges are unanimous in the pronouncement that such an interpretation sheds an entirely new light on the part of phedre which is one of the finest and most studied of racines creations and that it constitutes the purest and most exalted manifestation of dramatic art which it has been the privilege of our generation to witness immediately my mind had conceived this new idea of the purest and most exalted manifestation of dramatic art it the idea sped to join the imperfect pleasure which i had felt in the theatre added to it a little of what was lacking and their combination formed something so exalting that i cried out within myself what a great artist it may doubtless be argued that i was not absolutely sincere but let us bear in mind rather the numberless writers who dissatisfied with the page which they have just written if they read some eulogy of the genius of chateaubriand or evoke the spirit of some great artist whose equal they aspire to be by humming to themselves for instance a phrase of beethoven the melancholy of which they compare with what they have been trying to express in prose are so filled with that idea of genius that they add it to their own productions when they think of them once again see them no longer in the light in which at first they appeared and hazarding an act of faith in the value of their work say to themselves after all without taking into account that into the total which determines their ultimate satisfaction they have introduced the memory of marvellous pages of chateaubriand which they assimilate to their own but of which in cold fact they are not the authors let us bear in mind the numberless men who believe in the love of a mistress on the evidence only of her betrayals all those too who are sustained by the alternative hopes either of an incomprehensible survival of death when they think inconsolable husbands of the wives whom they have lost but have not ceased to love or artists of the posthumous glory which they may thus enjoy or else the hope of complete extinction which comforts them when their thoughts turn to the misdeeds that otherwise they must expiate after death let us bear in mind also the travellers who come home enraptured by the general beauty of a tour of which from day to day they have felt nothing but the tedious incidents and let us then declare whether in the communal life that is led by our ideas in the enclosure of our minds there is a single one of those that make us most happy which has not first sought a very parasite and won from an alien but neighbouring idea the greater part of the strength that it originally lacked my mother appeared none too well pleased that my father no longer thought of the career for myself i fancy that anxious before all things that a definite rule of life should discipline the eccentricity of my nervous system what she regretted was not so much seeing me abandon diplomacy as the prospect of my devoting myself to literature but let him alone my father protested the main thing is that a man should find pleasure in his work he is no longer a child he knows pretty well now what he likes it is not at all probable that he will change and he is quite capable of deciding for himself what will make him happy in life that evening as i waited for the time to arrive when thanks to the freedom of choice which they allowed me i should or should not begin to be happy in life my fathers words caused me great uneasiness at all times his unexpected kindnesses had when they were manifested prompted in me so keen a desire to kiss above where his beard began his glowing cheeks that if i did not yield to that desire it was simply because i was afraid of annoying him and on that day as an author becomes alarmed when he sees the fruits of his own meditation which do not appear to him to be of great value since he does not separate them from himself oblige a publisher to choose a kind of paper to employ a fount of type finer perhaps than they deserve i asked myself whether my desire to write was of sufficient importance to justify my father in dispensing so much generosity but apart from that when he spoke of my inclinations as no longer liable to change he awakened in me two terrible suspicions the first was that at a time when every day i regarded myself as standing upon the threshold of a life which was still intact and would not enter upon its course until the following morning my existence was already begun and that furthermore what was yet to follow would not differ to any extent from what had already elapsed the second suspicion which was nothing more really than a variant of the first was that i was not situated somewhere outside the realm of time but was subject to its laws just like the people in novels who for that reason used to plunge me in such depression when i read of their lives down at combray in the fastness of my wicker sentrybox in theory one is aware that the earth revolves but in practice one does not perceive it the ground upon which one treads seems not to move and one can live undisturbed so it is with time in ones life and to make its flight perceptible novelists are obliged by wildly accelerating the beat of the pendulum to transport the reader in a couple of minutes over ten or twenty or even thirty years at the top of one page we have left a lover full of hope at the foot of the next we meet him again a bowed old man of eighty painfully dragging himself on his daily walk about the courtyard of an almshouse scarcely replying to what is said to him oblivious of the past in saying of me he is no longer a child his tastes will not change now and so forth my father had suddenly made me apparent to myself in my position in time and caused me the same kind of depression as if i had baen not yet the enfeebled old pensioner but one of those heroes of whom the author in a tone of indifference which is particularly galling says to us at the end of a book he very seldom comes up now from the country he has finally decided to end his days there meanwhile my father so as to forestall any criticism that we might feel tempted to make of our guest said to my mother upon my word old norpois was rather typical as you call it this evening was not he when he said that it would not have been seemly to ask the comte de paris a question i was quite afraid you would burst out laughing not at all answered my mother i was delighted to see a man of his standing and age too keep that sort of simplicity which is really a sign of straightforwardness and goodbreeding i should think so indeed that does not prevent his having a shrewd and discerning mind i know him well i see him at the commission remember where he is very different from what he was here exclaimed my father who was glad to see that mamma appreciated m de norpois and anxious to persucde her that he was even superior to what she supposed because a cordial nature exaggerates a friends qualities with as much pleasure as a mischievous one finds in depreciating them what was it that he said again with princes one never does know yes that was it i noticed it at the time it was very neat you can see that he has a vast experience of life the astonishing thing is that he should have been dining with the swanns and that he seems to have found quite respectable people there officials even how on earth can mme swann have managed to catch them did you notice the malicious way he said it is a house which is especially attractive to gentlemen and each of them attempted to reproduce the manner in which m de norpois had uttered these words as they might have attempted to capture some intonation of bressants voice or of thirons in laventuriere or in thegendre de m poirier but of all his sayings there was none so keenly relished as one was by françoise who years afterwards even could not keep a straight face if we reminded her that she had been qualified by the ambassador as a chef of the first order a compliment which my mother had gone in person to transmit to her as a war minister publishes the congratulations addressed to him by a visiting sovereign after the grand review i as it happened had preceded my mother to the kitchen for i had extorted from françoise who though opposed to war was cruel that she would because no undue suffering to the rabbit which she had to kill and i had had no report yet of its death françoise assured me that it had passed away as peacefully as could be desired and very swiftly i have never seen a beast like it it died without uttering a word you would have thought it was dumb being but little d in the language of beasts i suggested that the rabbit had not perhaps a cry like the chickens just wait till you see said françoise filled with contempt for my ignorance if rabbits do not cry every bit as much as chickens why they are far noisier she received the compliments of m de norpois with the proud simplicity the joyful and if but for the moment intelligent expression of an artist when someone speaks to him of his art my mother had sent her when she first came to us to several of the big restaurants to see how the cooking there was done i had the same pleasure that evening in hearing her dismiss the most famous of them as mere cookshops that i had had long ago when i learned with regard to theatrical artists that the hierarchy of their merits did not at all correspond to that of their reputations the ambassador my mother told her assured me that he knows no place where he can get cold beef and soufflés as good as yours françoise with an air of modesty and of paying just homage to the truth agreed but seemed not at all impressed by the title ambassador she said of m de norpois with the friendliness due to a man who had taken her for a chef he is a good old soul like me she had indeed hoped to catch sight of him as he arrived but knowing that mamma hated their standing about behind doors and in windows and thinking that mamma would get to know from the other servants or from the porter that she had been keeping watch for françoise saw everywhere nothing but jealousies and talebearings which played the same grim and unending part in her imagination as do for others of us the intrigues of the jesuits or the jews she had contented herself with a peep from the kitchen window so as not to have words with madame and beneath the momentary aspect of m de norpois had thought it was monsieur legrand because of what she called his agelity and in spite of their having not a single point in common well inquired my mother and how do you explain that nobody else can make a jelly as well as you when you choose i really could not say how that becomes about replied françoise who had established no very clear line of demarcation between the verb to come in certain of its meanings at least and the verb to become she was speaking the truth if not the whole truth being scarcely more capable or desirous of revealing the mystery which ensured the superiority of her jellies or her creams than a leader of fashion the secrets of her toilet or a great singer those of her song their explanations tell us little it was the same with the recipes furnished by our cook they do it in too much of a hurry she went on alluding to the great restaurants and then it is not all done together you want the beef to become like a sponge then it will drink up all the juice to the last drop still there was one of those cafés where i thought they did know a little bit about cooking i do not say it was altogether my jelly but it was very nicely done and the soufflés had plenty of cream do you mean henrys asked my father who had now joined us for he greatly enjoyed that restaurant in the place gaillon where he went regularly to club dinners oh dear no said françoise with a mildness which cloaked her profound contempt i meant a little restaurant at that henrys it is all very good sure enough but it is not a restaurant it is more like a soupkitchen webers then oh no sir i meant a good restaurant webers that is in the rue royale that is not a restaurant it is a drinkingshop i do not know that the food they give you there is even served i think they do not have any tablecloths they just shove it down in front of you like that with a take it or leave it giros oh there i should say they have the cooking done by ladies of the world world meant for françoise the underworld lord they need that to fetch the boys in we could see that with all her air of simplicity françoise was for the celebrities of her profession a more disastrous comrade than the most jealous the most infatuated of actresses we felt all the same that she had a proper feeling for her art and a respect for tradition for she went on no i mean a restaurant where they looked as if they kept a very good little family table it is a place of some consequence too plenty of custom there oh they raked in the coppers there all right françoise being an economist reckoned in coppers where your plunger would reckon in gold madame knows the place well enough down there to the right along the main boulevards a little way back the restaurant of which she spoke with this blend of pride and goodhumoured tolerance was it turned out the café anglais when new years day came i first of all paid a round of family visits with mamma who so as not to tire me had planned them beforehand with the aid of an itinerary drawn up by my father according to districts rather than to degrees of kinship but no sooner had we entered the drawingroom of the distant cousin whose claim to being visited first was that her house was at no distance from ours than my mother was horrified to see standing there his present of marrons glacés or déguisés in his hand the bosom friend of the most sensitive of all my uncles to whom he would at once go and report that we had not begun our round with him and this uncle would certainly be hurt he would have thought it quite natural that we should go from the madeleine to the jardin des plantes where he lived before stopping at saintaugustin on our way to the rue de lecole de médecine our visits ended my grandmother had dispensed us from the duty of calling on her since we were to dine there that evening i ran all the way to the champselysées to give to our own special stallkeeper with instructions to hand it over to the person who came to her several times a week from the swanns to buy gingerbread the letter which on the day when my friend had caused me so much anxiety i had decided to send her at the new year and in which i told her that our old friendship was vanishing with the old year that i would forget now my old sorrows and disappointments and that from this first day of january it was a new friendship that we were going to cement one so solid that nothing could destroy it so wonderful that i hoped that gilberte would go out of her way to preserve it in all its beauty and to warn me in time as i promised to warn her should either of us detect the least sign of a peril that might endanger it on our way home françoise made me stop at the corner of the rue royale before an openair stall from which she selected for her own stock of presents photographs of pius ix and raspail while for myself i purchased one of berma the innumerable admiration which that artist excited gave an air almost of poverty to this one face that she had to respond with unalterable and precarious as are the garments of people who have not a change this face on which she must continually expose to view only the tiny dimple upon her upper lip the arch of her eyebrows a few other physical peculiarities always the same which when it came to that were at the mercy of a burn or a blow this face moreover could not in itself have seemed to me beautiful but it gave me the idea and consequently the desire to kiss it by reason of all the kisses that it must have received for which from its page in the album it seemed still to be appealing with that coquettishly tender gaze that artificially ingenuous smile for our berma must indeed have felt for many young men those longings which she confessed under cover of the personality of phaedra longings of which everything even the glamour of her name which enhanced her beauty and prolonged her youth must render the gratification so easy to her night was falling i stopped before a column of playbills on which was posted that of the piece in which she was to appear on january a moist and gentle breeze was blowing it was a time of day and year that i knew i suddenly felt a presentiment that new years day was not a day different from the rest that it was not the first day of a new world in which i might by a chance that had never yet occurred that was still intact make gilbertes acquaintance afresh as at the creation of the world as though the past had no longer any existence as though there had been obliterated with the indications which i might have preserved for my future guidance the disappointments which she had sometimes brought me a new world in which nothing should subsist from the old save one thing my desire that gilberte should love me i realised that if my heart hoped for such a reconstruction round about it of a uni that had not satisfied it before it was because my heart had not altered and i told myself that there was no reason why gilbertes should have altered either i felt that this new friendship was the same just as there is no boundary ditch between their forerunners and those new years which our desire for them without being able to reach and so to modify them invests unknown to themselves with distinctive names i might dedicate this new year if i chose to gilberte and as one bases a religious system upon the blind laws of nature endeavour to stamp new years day with the particular image that i had formed of it but in vain i felt that it was not aware that people called it new years day that it was passing in a wintry dusk in a manner that was not novel to me in the gentle breeze that floated about the column of playbills i had recognised i had felt reappear the eternal the universal substance the familiar moisture the unheeding fluidity of the old days and years i returned to the house i had spent the new years day of old men who differ on that day from their juniors not because people have ceased to give them presents but because they themselves have ceased to believe in the new year presents i had indeed received but not that present which alone could bring me pleasure namely a line from gilberte i was young still none the less since i had been able to write her one by means of which i hoped in telling her of my solitary dreams of love and longing to arouse similar dreams in her the sadness of men who have grown old lies in their no longer even thinking of writing such letters the futility of which their experience has shewn after i was in bed the noises of the street unduly prolonged upon this festive evening kept me awake i thought of all the people who were ending the night in pleasure of the lover the troop it might be of debauchees who would be going to meet berma at the stagedoor after the play that i had seen announced for this evening i was not even able so as to calm the agitation which that idea engendered in me during my sleepless night to assure myself that berma was not perhaps thinking about love since the lines that she was reciting which she had long and carefully rehearsed reminded her at every moment that love is an exquisite thing as of course she already knew and knew so well that she displayed its familiar pangs only enriched with a new violence and an unsuspected sweetness to her astonished audience and yet each of them had felt those pangs himself i lighted my candle again to look once more upon her face at the thought that it was no doubt at that very moment being caressed by those men whom i could not prevent from giving to berma and receiving from her joys superhuman but vague i felt an emotion more cruel than voluptuous a longing that was aggravated presently by the sound of a horn as one hears it on the nights of the lenten carnival and often of other public holidays which because it then lacks all poetry is more saddening coming from a toy squeaker than at evening in the depth of the woods at that moment a message from gilberte would perhaps not have been what i wanted our desires cut across one anothers paths and in this confused existence it is but rarely that a piece of good fortune coincides with the desire that clamoured for it i continued to go to the champselysées on fine days along streets whose stylish pink houses seemed to be washed because exhibitions of watercolours were then at the height of fashion in a lightly floating atmosphere it would be untrue to say that in those days the palaces of gabriel struck me as being of greater beauty or even of another epoch than the adjoining houses i found more style and should have supposed more antiquity if not in the palais de lindustrie at any rate in the trocadéro plunged in a restless sleep my adolescence embodied in one uniform vision the whole of the quarter through which it might be strolling and i had never dreamed that there could be an eighteenth century building in the rue royale just as i should have been astonished to learn that the portesaintmartin and the portesaintdenis those glories of the age of louis xiv were not contemporary with the most recently built tenements in the sordid regions that bore their names once only one of gabriels palaces made me stop for more than a moment that was because night having fallen its columns dematerialised by the moonlight had the appearance of having been cut out in pasteboard and by recalling to me a scene in the operetta orphée aux enfers gave me for the first time an impression of beauty meanwhile gilberte never came to the champselysées and yet it was imperative that i should see her for i could not so much as remember what she was like the questing anxious exacting way that we have of looking at the person we love our eagerness for the word which shall give us or take from us the hope of an appointment for the morrow and until that word is uttered our alternative if not simultaneous imaginings of joy and of despair all these make our observation in the beloved objects presence too tremulous to be able to carry away a clear impression of her perhaps also that activity of all the senses at once which endeavours to learn from the visible aspect alone what lies behind it is overindulgent to the thousand forms to the changing fragrance to the movements of the living person whom as a rule when we are not in love we regard as fixed in one permanent position whereas the beloved model does not stay still and our mental photographs of her are always blurred i did not rightly know how gilbertes features were composed save in the heavenly moments when she disclosed them to me i could remember nothing but her smile and not being able to see again that beloved face despite every effort that i might make to recapture it i would be disgusted to find outlined in my memory with a maddening precision of detail the meaningless emphatic faces of the man with the wooden horses and of the barleysugar woman just as those who have lost a dear friend whom they never see even while they are asleep are exasperated at meeting incessantly in their dreams any number of insupportable creatures whom it is quite enough to have known in the waking world in their inability to form any image of the object of their grief they are almost led to assert that they feel no grief and i was not far from believing that since i could not recall the features of gilberte i had forgotten gilberte herself and no longer loved her at length she returned to play there almost every day setting before me fresh pleasures to desire to demand of her for the morrow indeed making my love for her every day in this sense a new love but an incident was to change once again and abruptly the manner in which at about two of the clock every afternoon the problem of my love confronted me had m swann intercepted the letter that i had written to his daughter or was gilberte merely confessing to me long after the event and so that i should be more prudent in future a state of things already long established as i was telling her how greatly i admired her father and mother she assumed that vague air full of reticence and kept secrets which she invariably wore when anyone spoke to her of what she was going to do her walks drives visits then suddenly expressed it with you know they cannot abide you and slipping from me like the undine that she was burst out laughing often her laughter out of harmony with her words seemed as music seems to be tracing an invisible surface on another plane m and mme swann did not require gilberte to give up playing with me but they would have been just as well pleased she thought if we had never begun they did not look upon our relations with a kindly eye they believed me to be a young person of low moral standard and imagined that my influence over their daughter must be evil this type of unscrupulous young man whom the swanns thought that i resembled i pictured him to myself as detesting the parents of the girl he loved flattering them to their faces but when he was alone with her making fun of them urging her on to disobey them and when once he had completed his conquest not allowing them even to set eyes on her again with these characteristics though they are never those under which the basest of scoundrels recognises himself how vehemently did my heart contrast the sentiments that did indeed animate it with regard to swann so passionate on the contrary that i never doubted that were he to have the least suspicion of them he must repent of his condemnation of me as of a judicial error all that i felt about him i made bold to express to him in a long letter which i entrusted to gilberte with the request that she would deliver it she consented alas so he saw in me an even greater impostor than i had feared those sentiments which i had supposed myself to be portraying in sixteen pages with such amplitude of truth so he had suspected them in short the letter that i had written him as ardent and as sincere as the words that i had uttered to m de norpois met with no more success gilberte told me next day after taking me aside behind a clump of laurels along a little path by which we sat down on a couple of chairs that as he read my letter which she had now brought back to me her father had shrugged his shoulders with all this means nothing it only goes to prove how right i was i who knew the purity of my intentions the goodness of my soul was furious that my words should not even have impinged upon the surface of swanns ridiculous error for it was an error of that i had then no doubt i felt that i had described with such accuracy certain irrefutable characteristics of my generous sentiments that if swann had not at once reconstructed these from my indications had not come to ask my forgiveness and to admit that he had been mistaken it must be because these noble sentiments he had never himself experienced which would make him incapable of understanding the existence of them in other people well perhaps it was simply that swann knew that generosity is often no more than the inner aspect which our egotistical feelings assume when we have not yet named and classified them perhaps he had recognised in the sympathy that i expressed for him simply an effect and the strongest possible proof of my love for gilberte by which and not by any subordinate veneration of himself my subsequent actions would be irresistibly controlled i was unable to share his point of view since i had not succeeded in abstracting my love from myself in forcing it back into the common experience of humanity and thus suffering experimentally its consequences i was in despair i was obliged to leave gilberte for a moment françoise had called me i must accompany her into a little pavilion covered in a green trellis not unlike one of the disused tollhouses of old paris in which had recently been installed what in england they call a lavatory but in france by an illinformed piece of anglomania waterclosets the old damp walls at the entrance where i stood waiting for françoise emitted a chill and fusty smell which relieving me at once of the anxieties that swanns words as reported by gilberte had just awakened in me pervaded me with a pleasure not at all of the same character as other pleasures which leave one more unstable than before incapable of retaining them of possessing them but on the contrary with a consistent pleasure on which i could lean for support delicious soothing rich with a truth that was lasting unexplained and certain i should have liked as long ago in my walks along the guermantes way to endeavour to penetrate the charm of this impression which had seized hold of me and remaining there motionless to interrogate this antiquated emanation which invited me not to enjoy the pleasure which it was offering me only as an extra but to descend into the underlying reality which it had not yet disclosed to me but the tenant of the establishment an elderly dame with painted cheeks and an auburn wig was speaking to me françoise thought her very welltodo indeed her missy had married what françoise called a young man of family which meant that he differed more in her eyes from a workman than in saintsimons a duke did from a man risen from the dregs of the people no doubt the tenant before entering upon her tenancy had met with res but françoise was positive that she was a marquise and belonged to the saintferréold family this marquise warned me not to stand outside in the cold and even opened one of her doors for me saying will not you go inside for a minute look here is a nice clean one and i shall not charge you anything perhaps she just made this offer in the spirit in which the young ladies at gouaches when we went in there to order something used to offer me one of the sweets which they kept on the counter under glass bells and which alas mamma would never allow me to take perhaps with less innocence like an old florist whom mamma used to have in to replenish her flowerstands who rolled languishing eyes at me as she handed me a rose in any event if the marquise had a weakness for little boys when she threw open to them the hypogean doors of those cubicles of stone in which men crouch like sphinxes she must have been moved to that generosity less by the hope of corrupting them than by the pleasure which all of us feel in displaying a needless prodigality to those whom we love for i have never seen her with any other visitor except an old parkkeeper a moment later i said goodbye to the marquise and went out accompanied by françoise whom i left to return to gilberte i caught sight of her at once on a chair behind the clump of laurels she was there so as not to be seen by her friends they were playing at hideandseek i went and sat down by her side she had on a flat cap which drooped forwards over her eyes giving her the same underhand brooding crafty look which i had remarked in her that first time at comb ray i asked her if there was not some way for me to have it out with her father face to face gilberte said that she had suggested that to him but that he had not thought it of any use look she went on do not go away without your letter i must run along to the others as they have not caught me had swann appeared on the scene then before i had recovered it this letter by the sincerity of which i felt that he had been so unreasonable in not letting himself be convinced perhaps he would have seen that it was he who had been in the right for as i approached gilberte who leaning back in her chair told me to take the letter but did not hold it out to me i felt myself so irresistibly attracted by her body that i said to her look you try to stop me from getting it we will see which is the stronger she thrust it behind her back i put my arms round her neck raising the plaits of hair which she wore over her shoulders either because she was still of an age for that or because her mother chose to make her look a child for a little longer so that she herself might still seem young and we wrestled locked together i tried to pull her towards me she resisted her cheeks inflamed by the effort were as red and round as two cherries she laughed as though i were tickling her i held her gripped between my legs like a young tree which i was trying to climb and in the middle of my gymnastics when i was already out of breath with the muscular exercise and the heat of the game i felt as it were a few drops of sweat wrung from me by the effort my pleasure express itself in a form which i could not even pause for a moment to analyse immediately i snatched the letter from her whereupon gilberte said goodnaturedly you know if you like we might go on wrestling for a little perhaps she was dimly conscious that my game had had another object than that which i had avowed but too dimly to have been able to see that i had attained it and i who was afraid that she had seen and a slight recoil as though of offended modesty which she made and checked a moment later made me think that my fear had not been unfounded agreed to go on wrestling lest she should suppose that i had indeed no other object than that after which i wished only to sit quietly by her side on my way home i perceived i suddenly recollected the impression concealed from me until then towards which without letting me distinguish or recognise it the cold almost sooty smell of the trellised pavilion had borne me it was that of my uncle adolphes little sittingroom at combray which had indeed exhaled the same odour of humidity but i could not understand and i postponed the attempt to discover why the recollection of so trivial an impression had given me so keen a happiness it struck me however that i did indeed deserve the contempt of m de norpois i had preferred hitherto to all other writers one whom he styled a mere fluteplayer and a positive rapture had been conveyed to me not by any important idea but by a mouldy smell for some time past in certain households the name of the champselysées if a visitor mentioned it would be greeted by the mother of the family with that air of contempt which mothers keep for a physician of established reputation whom they have or so they make out seen make too many false diagnoses to have any faith left in him people insisted that these gardens were not good for children that they knew of more than one sore throat more than one case of measles and any number of feverish chills for which the champs must be held responsible without venturing openly to doubt the maternal affection of mamma who continued to let me play there several of her friends deplored her inability to see what was as plain as daylight neurotic subjects are perhaps less addicted than any despite the timehonoured phrase to listening to their insides they can hear so many things going on inside themselves by which they realise later that they did wrong to let themselves be alarmed that they end by paying no attention to any of them their nervous systems have so often cried out to them for help as though from some serious malady when it was merely because snow was coming or because they had to change their rooms that they have acquired the habit of paying no more heed to these warnings than a soldier who in the heat of battle perceives them so little that he is capable although dying of carrying on for some days still the life of a man in perfect health one morning bearing arranged within me all my regular disabilities from whose constant internal circulation i kept my mind turned as resolutely away as from the circulation of my blood i had come running into the diningroom where my parents were already at table and having assured myself as usual that to feel cold may mean not that one ought to warm oneself but that for instance one has received a scolding and not to feel hungry that it is going to rain and not that one ought not to eat anything had taken my place between them when in the act of swallowing the first mouthful of a particularly tempting cutlet a nausea a giddiness stopped me the feverish reaction of a malady that had already begun the symptoms of which had been masked retarded by the ice of my indifference but which obstinately refused the nourishment that i was not in a fit state to absorb then at the same moment the thought that they would stop me from going out if they saw that i was unwell gave me as the instinct of selfpreservation gives a wounded man the strength to crawl to my own room where i found that i had a temperature of and then to get ready to go to the champselysées through the languid and vulnerable she will which encased them my eager thoughts were urging me towards were clamouring for the soothing delight of a game of prisoners base with gilberte and an hour later barely able to keep on my feet but happy in being by her side i had still the strength to enjoy it françoise on our return declared that i had been taken bad that i must have caught a hot and cold while the doctor who was called in at once declared that he preferred the severity the virulence of the rush of fever which accompanied my congestion of the lungs and would be no more than a fire of straw to other forms more insidious and septic for some time now i had been liable to choking fits and our doctor braving the disapproval of my grandmother who could see me already dying a drunkards death had recommended me to take as well as the caffeine which had been prescribed to help me to breathe beer champagne or brandy when i felt an attack coming these attacks would subside he told me in the euphoria brought about by the alcohol i was often obliged so that my grandmother should allow them to give it to me instead of dissembling almost to make a display of my state of suffocation on the other hand as soon as i felt an attack coming never being quite certain what proportions it would assume i would grow distressed at the thought of my grandmothers anxiety of which i was far more afraid than of my own sufferings but at the same time my body either because it was too weak to keep those sufferings secret or because it feared lest in their ignorance of the imminent disaster people might demand of me some exertion which it would have found impossible or dangerous gave me the need to warn my grandmother of my attacks with a punctiliousness into which i finally put a sort of physiological scruple did i perceive in myself a disturbing symptom which i had not previously observed my body was in distress so long as i had not communicated it to my grandmother did she pretend to pay no attention it made me insist sometimes i went too far and that dear face which was no longer able always to control its emotion as in the past would allow an expression of pity to appear a painful contraction then my heart was wrung by the sight of her grief as if my kisses had had power to expel that grief as if my affection could give my grandmother as much joy as my recovery i flung myself into her arms and its scruples being at the same time calmed by the certainty that she now knew the discomfort that i felt my body offered no opposition to my reassuring her i protested that this discomfort had been nothing that i was in no sense to be pitied that she might be quite sure that i was now happy my body had wished to secure exactly the amount of pity that it deserved and provided that someone knew that it had a pain in its right side it could see no harm in my declaring that this pain was of no consequence and was not an obstacle to my happiness for my body did not pride itself on its philosophy that was outside its province almost every day during my convalescence i passed through these crises of suffocation one evening after my grandmother had left me comparatively well she returned to my room very late and seeing me struggling for breath oh my poor boy she exclaimed her face quivering with sympathy you are in dreadful pain she left me at once i heard the outer gate open and in a little while she came back with some brandy which she had gone out to buy since there was none in the house presently i began to feel better my grandmother who was rather flushed seemed put out about something and her eyes had a look of weariness and dejection i shall leave you alone now and let you get the good of this improvement she said rising suddenly to go i detained her however for a kiss and could feel on her cold cheek something moist but did not know whether it was the dampness of the night air through which she had just passed next day she did not come to my room until the evening having had she told me to go out i considered that this shewed a surprising indifference to my welfare and i had to restrain myself so as not to reproach her with it as my chokings had persisted long after any congestion remained that could account for them my parents asked for a consultation with professor cottard it is not enough that a physician who is called in to treat cases of this sort should be learned brought face to face with symptoms which may or may not be those of three or four different complaints it is in the long run his instinct his eye that must decide with which despite the more or less similar appearance of them all he has to deal this mysterious gift does not imply any superiority in the other departments of the intellect and a creature of the utmost vulgarity who admires the worst pictures the worst music in whose mind there is nothing out of the common may perfectly well possess it in my case what was physically evident might equally well have been due to nervous spasms to the first stages of tuberculosis to asthma to a toxialimentary dyspnoea with renal insufficiency to chronic bronchitis or to a complex state into which more than one of these factors entered now nervous spasms required to be treated firmly and discouraged tuberculosis with infinite care and with a feedingup process which would have been bad for an arthritic condition such as asthma and might indeed have been dangerous in a case of toxialimentary dyspnoea this last calling for a strict diet which in return would be fatal to a tuberculous patient but cottards hesitations were brief and his prescriptions imperious purges violent and drastic purges milk for some days nothing but milk no meat no alcohol my mother murmured that i needed all the same to be built up that my nerves were already weak that drenching me like a horse and restricting my diet would make me worse i could see in cottards eyes as uneasy as though he were afraid of missing a train that he was asking himself whether he had not allowed his natural goodhumour to appear he was trying to think whether he had remembered to put on his mask of coldness as one looks for a mirror to see whether one has not forgotten to tie ones tie in his uncertainty and so as whatever he had done to put things right he replied brutally i am not in the habit of repeating my instructions give me a pen now remember milk later on when we have got the crises and the agrypnia by the throat i should like you to take a little clear soup and then a little broth but always with milk au lait you will enjoy that since spain is all the rage just now ollé ollé his pupils knew this joke well for he made it at the hospital whenever he had to put a heart or liver case on a milk diet after that you will gradually return to your normal life but whenever there is any coughing or choking purges injections bed milk he listened with icy calm and without uttering a word to my mothers final objections and as he left us without having condescended to explain the reasons for this course of treatment my parents concluded that it had no bearing on my case and would weaken me to no purpose and so they did not make me try it naturally they sought to conceal their disobedience from the professor and to succeed in this avoided all the houses in which he was likely to be found then as my health became worse they decided to make me follow out cottards prescriptions to the letter in three days my rattle and cough had ceased i could breathe freely whereupon we realised that cottard while finding as he told us later on that i was distinctly asthmatic and still more inclined to imagine things had seen that what was really the matter with me at the moment was intoxication and that by loosening my liver and washing out my kidneys he would get rid of the congestion of my bronchial tubes and thus give me back my breath my sleep and my strength and we realised that this imbecile was a clinical genius at last i was able to get up but they spoke of not letting me go any more to the champselysées they said that it was because the air there was bad but i felt sure that this was only a pretext so that i should not see mlle swann and i forced myself to repeat the name of gilberte all the time like the native tongue which peoples in captivity endeavour to preserve among themselves so as not to forget the land that they will never see again sometimes my mother would stroke my forehead with her hand saying so little boys do not tell mamma their troubles any more and françoise used to come up to me every day with what a face to be sure if you could just see yourself i anyone would think there was a corpse in the house it is true that if i had simply had a cold in the head françoise would have assumed the same funereal air these lamentations pertained rather to her class than to the state of my health i could not at the time discover whether this pessimism was due to sorrow or to satisfaction i decided provisionally that it was social and professional one day after the postman had called my mother laid a letter upon my bed i opened it carelessly since it could not bear the one signature that would have made me happy the name of gilberte with whom i had no relations outside the champselysées and lo at the foot of the page embossed with a silver seal representing a mans head in a helmet and under him a scroll with the device per viam rectam beneath a letter written in a large and flowing hand in which almost every word appeared to be underlined simply because the crosses of the ts ran not across but over them and so drew a line beneath the corresponding letters of the word above it was indeed gilbertes signature and nothing else that i saw but because i knew that to be impossible upon a letter addressed to myself the sight of it unaccompanied by any belief in it gave me no pleasure for a moment it merely struck an impression of unreality on everything round about me with lightning rapidity the impossible signature danced about my bed the fireplace the four walls i saw everything sway as one does when one falls from a horse and i asked myself whether there was not an existence altogether different from the one i knew in direct contradiction of it but itself the true existence which being suddenly revealed to me filled me with that hesitation which sculptors in representing the last judgment have given to the awakening dead who find themselves at the gates of the next world my dear friend said the letter i hear that you have been very ill and have given up going to the champseîysées i hardly ever go there either because there has been such an enormous lot of illness but i am having my friends to tea here every monday and friday mamma asks me to tell you that it will be a great pleasure to us all if you will come too as soon as you are well again and we can have some more nice talks here just like the champselysées goodbye dear friend i hope that your parents will allow you to come to tea very often with all my kindest regards gilberte while i was reading these words my nervous system was receiving with admirable promptitude the news that a piece of great good fortune had befallen me but my mind that is to say myself and in fact the party principally concerned was still in ignorance such good fortune coming from gilberte was a thing of which i had never ceased to dream a thing wholly in my mind it was as leonardo says of painting cosa mentale now a sheet of paper covered with writing is not a thing that the mind assimilates at once but as soon as i had finished reading the letter i thought of it it became an object of my dreams became it also cosa mentale and i loved it so much already that every few minutes i must read it kiss it again then at last i was conscious of my happiness life is strewn with these miracles for which people who are in love can always hope it is possible that this one had been artificially brought about by my mother who seeing that for some time past i had lost all interest in life may have suggested to gilberte to write to me just as when i was little and went first to the seaside so as to give me some pleasure in bathing which i detested because it took away my breath she used secretly to hand to the man who was to dip me marvellous boxes made of shells and branches of coral which i believed that i myself had discovered lying at the bottom of the sea however with every occurrence which in our life and among its contrasted situations bears any relation to love it is best to make no attempt to understand it since in so far as these are inexorable as they are unlookedfor they appear to be governed by magic rather than by rational laws when a multimillionaire who for all his millions is quite a charming person sent packing by a poor and unattractive woman with whom he has been living calls to his aid in his desperation all the resources of wealth and brings every worldly influence to bear without succeeding in making her take him back it is wiser for him in the face of the implacable obstinacy of his mistress to suppose that fate intends to crush him and to make him die of an affection of the heart than to seek any logical explanation these obstacles against which lovers have to contend and which their imagination overexcited by suffering seeks in vain to analyse are contained as often as not in some peculiar characteristic of the woman whom they cannot bring back to themselves in her stupidity in the influence acquired over her the fears suggested to her by people whom the lover does not know in the kind of pleasures which at the moment she is demanding of life pleasures which neither her lover nor her lovers wealth can procure for her in any event the lover is scarcely in a position to discover the nature of these obstacles which her womany cunning hides from him and his own judgment falsified by love prevents him from estimating exactly they may be compared with those tumours which the doctor succeeds in reducing but without having traced them to their source like them these obstacles remain mysterious but are temporary only they last as a rule longer than love itself and as that is not a disinterested passion the lover who is no longer in love does not seek to know why the woman neither rich nor virtuous with whom he was in love refused obstinately for years to let him continue to keep her now the same mystery which often veils from our eyes the reason for a catastrophe when love is in question envelops just as frequently the suddenness of certain happy solutions such as had come to me with gilbertes letter happy or at least seemingly happy for there are few solutions that can really be happy when we are dealing with a sentiment of such a kind that every satisfaction which we can bring to it does no more as a rule than dislodge some pain and yet sometimes a respite is granted us and we have for a little while the illusion that we are healed so far as concerns this letter at the foot of which françoise declined to recognise gilbertes name because the elaborate capital g leaning against the undotted i looked more like an a while the final syllable was indefinitely prolonged by a waving flourish if we persist in looking for a rational explanation of the sudden reversal of her attitude towards me which it indicated and which made me so radiantly happy we may perhaps find that i was to some extent indebted for it to an incident which i should have supposed on the contrary to be calculated to ruin me for ever in the sight of the swann family a short while back bloch had come to see me at a time when professor cottard whom now that i was following his instructions we were again calling in happened to be in my room as his examination of me was over and he was sitting with me simply as a visitor because my parents had invited him to stay to dinner bloch was allowed to come in while we were all talking bloch having mentioned that he had heard it said that mme swann was very fond of me by a lady with whom he had been dining the day before who was herself very intimate with mme swann i should have liked to reply that he was most certainly mistaken and to establish the fact from the same scruple of conscience that had made me proclaim it to m de norpois and for fear of mme swanns taking me for a liar that i did not know her and had never spoken to her but i had not the courage to correct blochs mistake because i could see quite well that it was deliberate and that if he invented something that mme swann could not possibly have said it was simply to let us know what he considered flattering to himself and was not true either that he had been dining with one of that ladys friends and so it fell out that whereas m de norpois on learning that i did not know but would very much like to know mme swann had taken great care to avoid speaking to her about me cottard who was her doctor also having gathered from what he had heard bloch say that she knew me quite well and thought highly of me concluded that to remark when next he saw her that i was a charming young fellow and a great friend of his could not be of the smallest use to me and would be of advantage to himself two reasons which made him decide to speak of me to odette whenever an opportunity arose thus at length i found my way into that abode from which was wafted even on to the staircase the scent that mme swann used though it was embalmed far more sweetly still by the peculiar disturbing charm that emanated from the life of gilberte the implacable porter transformed into a benevolent eumenid adopted the custom when i asked him if i might go upstairs of indicating to me by raising his cap with a propitious hand that he gave ear to my prayer those windows which seen from outside used to interpose between me and the treasures within which were not intended for me a polished distant and superficial stare which seemed to me the very stare of the swanns themselves it fell to my lot when in the warm weather i had spent a whole afternoon with gilberte in her room to open them myself so as to let in a little air and even to lean over the sill of one of them by her side if it was her mothers at home day to watch the visitors arrive who would often raising their heads as they stepped out of their carriages greet me with a wave of the hand taking me for some nephew of their hostess at such moments gilbertes plaits used to brush my cheek they seemed to me in the fineness of their grain at once natural and supernatural and in the strength of their constructed tracery a matchless work of art in the composition of which had been used the very grass of paradise to a section of them even infinitely minute what celestial herbary would i not have given as a reliquary but since i never hoped to obtain an actual fragment of those plaits if at least i had been able to have their photograph how far more precious than one of a sheet of flowers traced by vincis pencil to acquire one of these i stooped with friends of the swanns and even with photographers to servilities which did not procure for me what i wanted but tied me for life to a number of extremely tiresome people gilbertes parents who for so long had prevented me from seeing her now when i entered the dark hall in which hovered perpetually more formidable and more to be desired than at versailles of old the apparition of the king the possibility of my encountering them in which too invariably after butting into an enormous hatstand with seven branches like the candlestick in holy writ i would begin bowing confusedly before a footman seated among the skirts of his long grey coat upon the woodbox whom in the dim light i had mistaken for mme swann gilbertes parents if one of them happened to be passing at the moment of my arrival so far from seeming annoyed would come and shake hands with a smile and say how de do they both pronounced it in the same clipped way which you may well imagine once i was back at home i made an incessant and delightful practice of copying does gilberte know you are here she does then i will leave you to her better still the teaparties themselves to which gilberte invited her friends parties which for so long had seemed to me the most insurmountable of the barriers heaped up between her and myself became now an opportunity for uniting us of which she would inform me in a few lines written because i was still a comparative stranger upon sheets that were always different one was adorned with a poodle embossed in blue above a fantastic inscription in english with an exclamation mark after it another was stamped with an anchor or with the monogram g s preposterously elongated in a rectangle which ran from top to bottom of the page or else with the name gilberte now traced across one corner in letters of gold which imitated my friends signature and ended in a flourish beneath an open umbrella printed in black now enclosed in a monogram in the shape of a chinamans hat which contained all the letters of the word in capitals without its being possible to make out a single one of them at last as the series of different writingpapers which gilberte possessed numerous as it might be was not unlimited after a certain number of weeks i saw reappear the sheet that bore like the first letter she had written me the motto per vaim rectam and over it the mans head in a helmet set in a medallion of tarnished silver and each of them was chosen on one day rather than another by virtue of a certain ritual as i then supposed but more probably as i now think because she tried to remember which of them she had already used so as never to send the same one twice to any of her correspondents of those at least whom she took special pains to please save at the longest possible intervals as on account of the different times of their lessons some of the friends whom gilberte used to invite to her parties were obliged to leave just as the rest were arriving while i was still on the stairs i could hear escaping from the hall a murmur of voices which such was the emotion aroused in me by the imposing ceremony in which i was to take part long before i had reached the landing broke all the bonds that still held me to my past life so that i did not even remember that i was to take off my muffler as soon as i felt too hot and to keep an eye on the clock so as not to be late in getting home that staircase besides aîl of wood as they were built about that time in certain houses in keeping with that henri ii style which had for so long been odettes ideal though she was shortly to lose interest in it and furnished with a placard to which there was no equivalent at home on which one read the words notice the lift must not be taken downstairs seemed to me a thing so marvellous that i told my parents that it was an ancient staircase brought from ever so far away by m swann my regard for the truth was so great that i should not have hesitated to give them this information even if i had known it to be false for it alone could enable them to feel for the dignity of the swanns staircase the same respect that i felt myself it was just as when one is talking to some ignorant person who cannot understand in what the genius of a great physician consists it is as well not to admit that he does not know how to cure a cold in the head but since i had no power of observation since as a general rule i never knew either the name or the nature of things that were before my eyes and could understand only that when they were connected with the swanns they must be extraordinary i was by no means certain that in notifying my parents of the artistic value and remote origin of the staircase i was guilty of falsehood it did not seem certain but it must have seemed probable for i felt myself turn very red when my father interrupted me with i know those houses i have been in one they are all alike swann just has several floors in one it was berlier built them all he added that he had thought of taking a flat in one of them but that he had changed his mind finding that they were not conveniently arranged and that the landings were too dark so he said but i felt instinctively that my mind must make the sacrifices necessary to the glory of the swanns and to my own happiness and by a stroke of internal authority in spite of what i had just heard i banished for ever from my memory as a good catholic banishes renans vie de jésus the destroying thought that their house was just an ordinary flat in which we ourselves might have been living meanwhile on those teaparty days pulling myself up the staircase step by step reason and memory already cast off like outer garments and myself no more now than the sport of the basest reflexes i would arrive in the zone in which the scent of mme swann greeted my nostrils i felt that i could already behold the majesty of the chocolate cake encircled by plates heaped with little cakes and by tiny napkins of grey damask with figures on them as required by convention but peculiar to the swanns but this unalterable and governed whole seemed like kants necessary uni to depend on a supreme act of free will for when we were all together in gilbertes little sittingroom suddenly she would look at the clock and exclaim i say it is getting a long time since luncheon and we are not having dinner till eight i feel as if i could eat something what do you say and she would make us go into the diningroom as sombre as the interior of an asiatic temple painted by rembrandt in which an architectural cake as gracious and sociable as it was imposing seemed to be enthroned there in any event in case the fancy seized gilberte to discrown it of its chocolate battlements and to hew down the steep brown slopes of its ramparts baked in the oven like the bastions of the palace of darius better still in proceeding to the demolition of that babylonitish pastry gilberte did not consider only her own hunger she inquired also after mine while she extracted for me from the crumbling monument a whole glazed slab jewelled with scarlet fruits in the oriental styje she asked me even at what of the clock my parents were dining as if i still knew as if the disturbance that governed me had allowed to persist the sensation of satiety or of hunger the notion of dinner or the picture of my family in my empty memory and paralysed stomach alas its paralysis was but momentary the cakes that i took without noticing them a time would come when i should have to digest them but that time was still remote meanwhile gilberte was making my tea i went on drinking it indefinitely whereas a single cup would keep me awake for twentyfour hours which explains why my mother used always to say what a nuisance it is he can never go to the swarms without coming home ill but was i aware even when i was at the swanns that it was tea that i was drinking had i known i should have taken it just the same for even supposing that i had recovered for a moment the sense of the present that would not have restored to me the memory of the past or the apprehension of the future my imagination was incapable of reaching to the distant tune in which i might have the idea of going to bed and the need to sleep gilbertes girl friends were not all plunged in that state of intoxication in which it is impossible to make up ones mind some of them refused tea then gilberte would say using a phrase highly fashionable that year i can see i am not having much of a success with my tea and to destroy more completely any idea of ceremony she would disarrange the chairs that were drawn up round the table with we look just like a wedding breakfast good lord what fools servants are she nibbled her cake perched sideways upon a crosslegged seat placed at an angle to the table and then just as though she could have had all those cakes at her disposal without having first asked leave of her mother when mme swann whose day coincided as a rule with gilbertes teaparties had shewn one of her visitors to the door and came sweeping in a moment later dressed sometimes in blue velvet more often in a black satin gown draped with white lace she would say with an air of astonishment i say that looks good what you have got there it makes me quite hungry to see you all eating cake but mamma do we invite you gilberte would answer thank you no my precious what would my visitors say i have still got mme trombert and mme cottard and mme bontemps you know dear mme bontemps never pays very short visits and she has only just come what would all those good people say if i never went back to them if no one else calls i will come in again and have a chat with you which will be far more amusing after they have all gone i really think i have earned a little rest i have had fortyfive different people today and fortytwo of them told me about gérômes picture but you must come alone one of these days she turned to me and take your tea with gilberte she will make it for you just as you like it as you have it in your own little studio she went on flying off to her visitors as if it had been something as familiar to me as my own habits such as the habit that i should have had of taking tea had i ever taken it as for my studio i was uncertain whether i had one or not that i had come to seek in this mysterious world when can you come tomorrow we will make you toast every bit as good as you get at colombins no you are horrid for since she also had begun to form a salon she had borrowed mme verdurins mannerisms and notably her tone of petulant autocracy toast being as incomprehensible to me as colombins this further promise could not add to my temptation it will appear stranger still now that everyone uses such expressions and perhaps even at combray they are creeping in that i had not at first understood of whom mme swann was speaking when i heard her sing the praises of our old nurse i did not know any english i gathered however as she went on that the word was intended to denote françoise i who in the champselysées had been so terrified of the bad impression that she must make i now learned from mme swann that it was all the things that gilberte had told them about my nurse that had attracted her husband and her to me one feels that she is so devoted to you she must be nice at once my opinion of françoise was diametrically changed by the same token to have a governess equipped with a waterproof and a feather in her hat no longer appeared quite so essential finally i learned from some words which mme swann let fall with regard to mme blatin whose good nature she recognised but dreaded her visits that personal relations with that lady would have been of less value to me than i had supposed and would not in any way have improved my standing with the swanns if i had now begun to explore with tremors of reverence and joy the faery domain which against all probability had opened to me its hitherto locked approaches this was still only in my capacity as a friend of gilberte the kingdom into which i was received was itself contained within another more mysterious still in which swann and his wife led their supernatural existence and towards which they made their way after taking my hand in theirs when they crossed the hall at the same moment as myself but in the other direction but soon i was to penetrate also to the heart of the sanctuary for instance gilberte might be out when i called but m or mme swann was at home they would ask who had rung and on being told that it was myself would send out to ask me to come in for a moment and talk to them desiring me to use in one way or another and with this or that object in view my influence over their daughter i reminded myself of that letter so complete so convincing which i had written to swann only the other day and which he had not deigned even to acknowledge i marvelled at the impotence of the mind the reason and the heart to effect the least conversion to solve a single one of those difficulties which in the sequel life without ones so much as knowing what steps it has taken so easily unravels my new position as the friend of gilberte endowed with an excellent influence over her entitling me now to enjoy the same favours as if having had as a companion at some school where they had always put me at the head of my class the son of a king i had owed to that accident the right of informal entry into the palace and to audiences in the throneroom swann with an infinite benevolence and as though he were not overburdened with glorious occupations would make me go into his library and there let me for an hour on end respond in stammered monosyllables timid silences broken by brief and incoherent bursts of courage to utterances of which my emotion prevented me from understanding a single word would shew me works of art and books which he thought likely to interest me things as to which i had no doubt before seeing them that they infinitely surpassed in beauty anything that the louvre possessed or the national library but at which i found it impossible to look at such moments i should have been grateful to swanns butler had he demanded from me my watch my tiepin my boots and made me sign a deed acknowledging him as my heir in the admirable words of a popular expression of which as of the most famous epics we do not know who was the author although like those epics and with all deference to wolff and his theory it most certainly had an author one of those inventive modest souls such as we come across every year who light upon such gems as putting a name to a face though their own names they never let us learn i did not know what i was doing all the greater was my astonishment when my visit was prolonged at finding to what a zero of realisation to what an absence of happy ending those hours spent in the enchanted dwelling led me but my disappointment arose neither from the inadequacy of the works of art that were shewn to me nor from the impossibility of fixing upon them my distracted gaze for it was not the intrinsic beauty of the objects themselves that made it miraculous for me to be sitting in swanns library it was the attachment to those objects which might have been the ugliest in the world of the particular feeling melancholy and voluptuous which i had for so many years localised in that room and which still impregnated it similarly the multitude of mirrors of silverbacked brushes of altars to saint anthony of padua carved and painted by the most eminent artists her friends counted for nothing in the feeling of my own unworthiness and of her regal benevolence which was aroused in me when mme swann received me for a moment in her own room in which three beautiful and impressive creatures her principal and second and third maids smilingly prepared for her the most marvellous toilets and towards which on the order conveyed to me by the footman in kneebreeches that madame wished to say a few words to me i would make my way along the tortuous path of a corridor all embalmed far and near by the precious essences which exhaled without ceasing from her dressingroom a fragrance exquisitely sweet when mme swann had returned to her visitors we could still hear her talking and laughing for even with only two people in the room and as though she had to cope with all the good friends at once she would raise her voice ejaculate her words as she had so often in the little clan heard its mistress do at the moments when she led the conversation the expressions which we have borrowed from other people being those which for a time at least we are fondest of using mme swann used to select at one time those which she had learned from distinguished psople whom her husband had not managed to prevent her from getting to know it was from them that she derived the mannerism which consists in suppressing the article or demonstrative pronoun in french before an adjective qualifying a persons name at another time others more plebeian such as it is a mere nothing the favourite expression of one of her friends and used to make room for them in all the stories which by a habit formed among the little clan she loved to tell about people she would follow these up automatically with i do love that story or do admit it is a verygood story which came to her through her husband from the guermantes whom she did not know mme swann had left the diningroom but her husband who had just returned home made his appearance among us in turn do you know if your mother is alone gilberte no papa she has still some people what still at seven of the clock it is appalling the poor woman must be absolutely dead it is odious at home i had always heard the first syllable of this word pronounced with a long of like ode but m and mme swann made it short as in odd just think of it ever since two of the clock this afternoon he went on turning to me and camille tells me that between four and five he let in at least a dozen people did i say a dozen i believe he told me fourteen no a dozen i do not remember when i came home i had quite forgotten it was her day and when i saw all those carriages outside the door i thought there must be a wedding in the house and just now while i have been in the library for a minute the bell has never stopped ringing upon my word it is given me quite a headache and are there a lot of them in there still no only two who are they do you know mme cottard and mme bontemps oh the wife of the chief secretary to the minister of posts i know her husbands a clerk in some ministry or other but i do not know what he does gilberte assumed a babyish manner what is that you silly child you talk as if you were two years old what do you mean a clerk in some ministry or other indeed he is nothing less than chief secretary chief of the whole show and what is more what on earth am i thinking of upon my word i am getting as stupid as yourself he is not the chief secretary he is the permanent secretary i do not know i am sure does that mean a lot being permanent secretary answered gilberte who never let slip an opportunity of displaying her own indifference to anything that gave her parents because for vanity she may of course have considered that she only enhanced the brilliance of such an acquaintance by not seeming to attach any undue importance to it i should think it did mean a lot exclaimed swann who preferred to this modesty which might have left me in doubt a more explicit mode of speech why it means simply that he is the first man after the minister in fact he is more important than the minister because it is he that does all the work besides it appears that he has immense capacity a man quite of the first rank a most distinguished individual he is an officer of the legion of honour a delightful man he is and very goodlooking too this mans wife incidentally had married him against everyone is wishes and advica because he was a charming creature he had what may be sufficient to constitute a rare and delicate whole a fair silky beard good features a nasal voice powerful lungs and a glass eye i may tell you he added turning again to me that i am greatly amused to see that lot serving in the present government because they are bontemps of the bontempschenut family typical oldfashioned middleclass people reactionary clerical tremendously straitlaced your grandfather knew quite well at least by name and by sight he must have known old chenut the father who never tipped the cabmen more than a hapenny though he was a rich enough man for those days and the baron bréauchenut all their money went in the union générale smash you are too young to remember that of course and gad they have had to get it back as best they could he is the uncle of a little girl who used to come to my lessons in a class a long way below mine the famous albertine she is certain to be dreadfully fast when she is older but just now she is the quaintest spectacle she is amazing this daughter of mine she knows everyone i do not know her i only used to see her going about and hear them calling albertine here and albertine there but i do know mme bontemps and i do not like her much either you are quite wrong she is charming pretty intelligent in fact she is quite clever i shall go in and say how de do to her and ask her if her husband thinks we are going to have war and whether we can rely on king theodosius he is bound to know do not you think since he is in the counsels of the gods it was not thus that swann used to talk in days gone by but which of us cannot call to mind some royal princess of limited intelligence who let herself be carried off by a footman and then ten years later tried to get back into society and found that people were not very willing to call upon her have we not found her spontaneously adopting the language of all the old bores and when we referred to some duchess who was at the height of fashion heard her say she came to see me only yesterday or i live a very quiet life so that it is superfluous to make a study of manners since we can deduce them all from psychological laws the swanns shared this eccentricity of people who have not many friends a visit an invitation a mere friendly word from some one ever so little prominent were for them events to which they aspired to give full publicity if bad luck would have it that the verdurins were in london when odette gave a rather smart dinnerparty arrangements were made by which some common friend was to cable a report to them across the channel even the complimentary letters and telegrams received by odette the swanns were incapable of keeping to themselves they spoke of them to their friends passed them from hand to hand thus the swanns drawingroom reminded one of a seaside hotel where telegrams containing the latest news are posted up on a board still people who had known the old swann not merely outside society as i had known him but in society in that guermantes set which with certain concessions to highnesses and duchesses was almost infinitely exacting in the matter of wit and charm from which banishment was sternly decreed for men of real eminence whom its members found boring or vulgar such people might have been astonished to observe that their old swann had ceased to be not only discreet when he spoke of his acquaintance but difficult when he was called upon to enlarge it how was it that mme bontemps so common so illnatured failed to exasperate him how could he possibly describe her as attractive the memory of the guermantes set must one would suppose have prevented him as a matter of fact it encouraged him there was certainly among the guermantes as compared with the great majority of groups in society taste indeed a refined taste but also a snobbishness from which there arose the possibility of a momentary interruption in the exercise of that taste if it were a question of some one who was not indispensable to their circle of a minister for foreign affairs a republican and inclined to be pompous or of an academician who talked too much their taste would be brought to bear heavily against him swann would condole with mme de guermantes on having had to sit next to such people at dinner at one of the embassies and they would a thousand times rather have a man of fashion that is to say a man of the guermantes kind good for nothing but endowed with the wit of the guermantes some one who was of the same chapel as themselves only a grand duchess a princess of the blood should she dine often with mme de guermantes would soon find herself enrolled in that chapel also without having any right to be there without being at all so endowed but with the simplicity of people in society from the moment they had her in their houses they went out of their way to find her attractive since they were unable to say that it was because she was attractive that they invited her swann coming to the rescue of mme de guermantes would say to her after the highness had gone after all she is not such a bad woman really she has quite a sense of the comic i do not suppose for a moment that she has mastered the critique of pure reason still she is not unattractive oh i do so entirely agree with you the duchess would respond besides she was a little frightened of us all you will see that she can be charming she is certainly a great deal less devastating than mme x the wife of the talkative academician and herself a remarkable woman who quotes twenty volumes at you oh but there is not any comparison between them the faculty of saying such things as these and of saying them sincerely swann had acquired from the duchess and had never lost he made use of it now with reference to the people who came to his house he forced himself to distinguish and to admire in them the qualities that every human being will display if we examine him with a prejudice in his favour and not with the distaste of the niceminded he extolled the merits of mme bontemps as he had once extolled those of the princesse de parme who must have been excluded from the guermantes set if there had not been privileged terms of admission for certain highnesses and if when they presented themselves for election no consideration had indeed been paid except to wit and charm we have seen already moreover that swann had always an inclination which he was now putting into practice only in a more lasting fashion to exchange his social position for another which in certain circumstances might suit him better it is only people incapable of analysing in their perception what at first sight appears indivisible who believe that ones position is consolidated with ones person one and the same man taken at successive points in his life will be found to breathe at different stages on the social ladder in atmospheres that do not of necessity become more and more refined whenever in any period of our existence we form or reform associations with a certain environment and feel that we can move at ease in it and are made comfortable we begin quite naturally to make ourselves fast to it by putting out roots and tendrils in so far as mme bontemps was concerned i believe also that swann in speaking of her with so much emphasis was not sorry to think that my parents would hear that she had been to see his wife to tell the truth in our house the names of the people whom mme swann was gradually getting to know pricked our curiosity more than they aroused our admiration at the name of mme trombert my mother exclaimed ah that is a new recruit and one who will bring in others and as though she found a similarity between the somewhat summary rapid and violent manner in which mme swann acquired her friends as it were by conquest and a colonial expedition mamma went on to observe now that the tromberts have surrendered the neighbouring tribes will not be long in coming in if she had passed mme swann in the street she would tell us when she came home i saw mme swann in all her warpaint she must have been embarking on some triumphant offensive against the massachutoes or the cingalese or the tromberts and so with all the new people whom i told her that i had seen in that somewhat composite and artificial society to which they had often been brought with great difficulty and from widely different surroundings mamma would at once divine their origin and speaking of them as of trophies dearly bought would say brought back from an expedition against the soandso as for mme cottard my father was astonished that mme swann could find anything to be gained by getting so utterly undistinguished a woman to come to her house and said in spite of the professors position i must say that i cannot understand it mamma on the other hand understood quite well she knew that a great deal of the pleasure which a woman finds in entering a class of society different from that in which she has previously lived would be lacking if she had no means of keeping her old associates informed of those others relatively more brilliant with whom she has replaced them therefore she requires an eyewitness who may be allowed to penetrate this new delicious world as a buzzing browsing insect bores its way into a flower and will then as the course of her visits may carry her spread abroad or so at least one hopes with the tidings a latent germ of envy and of wonder mme cottard who might have been created on purpose to fill this part belonged to that special category in a visiting list which mamma who inherited certain facets of her fathers turn of mind used to call the tell sparta people besides apart from another reason which did not come to our knowledge until many years later mme swann in inviting this goodnatured reserved and modest friend had no need to fear lest she might be introducing into her drawingroom on her brilliant days a traitor or a rival she knew what a vast number of homely blossoms that busy worker armed with her plume and cardcase could visit in a single afternoon she knew the creatures power of dissemination and basing her calculations upon the law of probability was led to believe that almost certainly some intimate of the verdurins would be bound to hear within two or three days how the governor of paris had left cards upon her or that m verdurin himself would be told how m le hault de pressagny the president of the horse show had taken them swann and herself to the king theodosius gala she imagined the verdurins as informed of these two events both so flattering to herself and of these alone because the particular materialisations in which we embody and pursue fame are but few in number by the default of our own minds which are incapable of imagining at one time all the forms which none the less we hope in a general way that fame will not fail simultaneously to assume for our benefit mme swann had however met with no success outside what was called the official world smart women did not go to her house it was not the presence there of republican notables that frightened them away in the days of my early childhood conservative society was to the last degree worldly and no good house would ever have opened its doors to a republican the people who lived in such an atmosphere imagined that the impossibility of ever inviting an opportunist still more a horrid radical to their parties was something that would endure for ever like oillamps and horsedrawn omnibuses but like a kaleidoscope which is every now and then given a turn society arranges successively in different orders elements which one would have supposed to be immovable and composes a fresh pattern before i had made my first communion ladies on the right side in politics had had the stupefaction of meeting while paying calls a smart jewess these new arrangements of the kaleidoscope are produced by what a philosopher would call a change of criterion the dreyfus case brought about another at a period rather later than that in which i began to go to mme swanns and the kaleidoscope scattered once again its little scraps of colour everything jewish even the smart lady herself fell out of the pattern and various obscure nationalities appeared in its place the most brilliant drawingroom in paris was that of a prince who was an austrian and ultracatholic if instead of the dreyfus case there had come a war with germany the base of the kaleidoscope would have been turned in the other direction and its pattern red the jews having shewn to the general astonishment that they were patriots also would have kept their position and no one would have cared to go any more or even to admit that he had ever gone to the austrian princes all this does not however prevent the people who move in it from imagining whenever society is stationary for the moment that no further change will occur just as in spite of having witnessed the birth of the telephone they decline to believe in the aeroplane meanwhile the philosophers of journalism are at work castigating the preceding epoch and not only the kind of pleasures in which it indulged which seem to them to be the last word in corruption but even the work of its artists and philosophers which have no longer the least value in their eyes as though they were indissolubly linked to the successive moods of fashionable frivolity the one thing that does not change is that at any and every time it appears that there have been great changes at the time when i went to mme swanns the dreyfus storm had not yet broken and some of the more prominent jews were extremely powerful none more so than sir rufus israels whose wife lady israels was swanns aunt she had not herself any intimate acquaintance so distinguished as her nephews while he since he did not care for her had never much cultivated her society although he was so far as was known her heir but she was the only one of swanns relatives who had any idea of his social position the others having always remained in the state of ignorance in that respect which had long been our own when from a family circle one of its members emigrates into high society which to him appears a feat without parallel until after the lapse of a decade he observes that it has been performed in other ways and for different reasons by more than one of the men whom he knew as boys he draws round about himself a zone of shadow a terra incognita which is clearly visible in its minutest details to all those who inhabit it with him but is darkest night and nothingness to those who may not penetrate it but touch its fringe without the least suspicion of its existence in their midst there being no news agency to furnish swanns lady cousins with intelligence of the people with whom he consorted it was before his appalling marriage of course with a smile of condescension that they would tell one another over family dinnertables that they had spent a virtuous sunday in going to see cousin charles whom regarding him as a poor relation who was inclined to envy their prosperity they used wittily to name playing upon the title of balzacs story le cousin bete lady israels however was letterperfect in the names and quality of the people who lavished upon swann a friendship of which she was frankly jealous her husbands family which almost equalled the rothschilds in importance had for several generations managed the affairs of the orleans princes lady israels being immensely rich exercised a wide influence and had employed it so as to ensure that no one whom she knew should be at home to odette one only had disobeyed her in secret the comtesse de marsantes and then as ill luck would have it odette having gone to call upon mme de marsantes lady israels had entered the room almost at her heels mme de marsantes was on tenterhooks with the craven impotence of those who are at liberty to act as they choose she did not address a single word to odette who thus found little encouragement to press further the invasion of a world which moreover was not at all that into which she would have liked to be welcomed in this complete detachment of the faubourg saintgermain odette continued to be regarded as the illiterate light woman utterly different from the respectable ladies well up in all the minutest points of genealogy who endeavoured to quench by reading biographies and memoirs their thirst for the aristocratic relations with which real life had omitted to provide them and swann for his part continued no doubt to be the lover in whose eyes all these peculiarities of an old mistress would appear lovable or at least inoffensive for i have often heard his wife profess what were really social heresies without his attempting whether from lingering affection for her loss of regard for society or weariness of the effort to make her perfect to correct them it was perhaps also another form of the simplicity which for so long had misled us at combray and which now had the effect that while he continued to know on his own account at least many highly distinguished people he did not make a point in conversation in his wifes drawingroom of our seeming to feel that they were of the smallest importance they had indeed less than ever for swann the centre of gravity of his life having been displaced in any case odettes ignorance of social distinctions was so dense that if the name of the princesse de guermantes were mentioned in conversation after that of the duchess her cousin so those ones are princes are they she would exclaim why they have gone up a step were anyone to say the prince in speaking of the duc de chartres she would put him right with the duke you mean he is duc de chartres not prince as for the duc dorléans son of the comte de paris that is funny the son is higher than the father she would remark adding for she was afflicted with anglomania thoseroyalties are so dreadfully confusing while to someone who asked her from what province the guermantes family came she replied from the aisne but so far as odette was concerned swann was quite blind not merely to these deficiencies in her education but to the general mediocrity of her intelligence more than that whenever odette repeated a silly story swann would sit listening to his wife with a complacency a merriment almost an admiration into which some survival of his desire for her must have entered while in the same conversation anything subtle anything deep even that he himself might say would be listened to by odette with an habitual lack of interest rather curtly with impatience and would at times be sharply contradicted and we must conclude that this enslavement of refinement by vulgarity is the rule in many households when we think conly of all the superior women who yield to the blandishments of a boor merciless in his censure of their most delicate utterances while they go into ecstasies with the infinite indulgence of love over the feeblest of his witticisms to return to the reasons which prevented odette at this period from making her way into the faubourg saintgermain it must be observed that the latest turn of the social kaleidoscope had been actuated by a series of scandals women to whose houses one had been going with entire confidence had been discovered to be common prostitutes if not british spies one would therefore for some time to come expect people so at least one supposed to be before anything else in a sound position regular settled accountable odette represented simply everything with which one had just severed relations and was incidentally to renew them at once for men their natures not altering from day to day seek in every new order a continuance of the old but to renew them by seeking it under another form which would allow one to be innocently taken in and to believe that it was no longer the same society as before the disaster however the scapegoats of that society and odette were too closely alike people who move in society are very shortsighted at the moment in which they cease to have any relations with the israelite ladies whom they have known while they are asking themselves how they are to fill the gap thus made in their lives they perceive thrust into it as by the windfall of a night of storm a new lady an israelite also but by virtue of her novelty she is not associated in their minds with her predecessors with what they are convinced that they must abjure she does not ask that they shall respect her god they take her up there was no question of antisemitism at the time when i used first to visit odette but she was like enough to it to remind people of what they wished for a while to avoid as for swann himself he was still a frequent visitor of several of his former acquaintance who of course were all of the very highest rank and yet when he spoke to us of the people whom he had just been to see i noticed that among those whom he had known in the old days the choice that he made was dictated by the same kind of taste partly artistic partly historic that inspired him as a collector and remarking that it was often some great lady or other of waning reputation who interested him because she had been the mistress of liszt or because one of balzacs novels was dedicated to her grandmother as he would purchase a drawing if chateaubriand had written about it i conceived a suspicion that we had at combray replaced one error that of regarding swann as a mere stockbroker who did not go into society by another when we supposed him to be one of the smartest men in paris to be a friend of the comte de paris meant nothing at all is not the world full of such friends of princes who would not be received in any house that was at all exclusive princes know themselves to be princes and are not snobs besides they believe themselves to be so far above everything that is not of their blood royal that great nobles and business men appear in the depths beneath them to be practically on a level but swann went farther than this not content with seeking in society such as it was when he fastened upon the names which inscribed upon its roll by the past were still to be read there a simple artistic and literary pleasure he indulged in the slightly vulgar diversion of arranging as it were social nosegays by grouping heterogeneous elements bringing together people taken at hazard here there and everywhere these experiments in the lighter side or what was to swann the lighter side of sociology did not stimulate an identical reaction with any regularity that is to say in each of his wifes friends i am thinking of asking the cottards to meet the duchesse de vendôme he would laughingly say to mme bontemps in the appetised tone of an epicure who has thought of and intends to try the substitution in a sauce of cayenne pepper for cloves but this plan which was in fact to appear quite humorous in an archaic sense of the word to the cottards had also the power of infuriating mme bontemps she herself had recently been presented by the swanns to the duchesse de vendôme and had found this as agreeable as it seemed to her natural the thought of winning renown from it at the cottards when she related to them what had happened had been by no means the least savoury ingredient of her pleasure but like those persons recently decorated who their investiture once accomplished would like to see the fountain of honour turned off at the main mme bontemps would have preferred that after herself no one else in her own circle of friends should be made known to the princess she denounced to herself of course the licentious taste of swann who in order to gratify a wretched aesthetic whim was obliging her to scatter to the winds at one swoop all the dust that she would have thrown in the eyes of the cottards when she told them about the duchesse de vendôme how was she even to dare to announce to her husband that the professor and his wife were in their turn to partake of this pleasure of which she had boasted to him as though it were unique and yet if the cottards could only be made to know that they were being invited not seriously but for the amusement of their host it is true that the bontemps had been invited for the same reason but swann having acquired from the aristocracy that eternal don juan spirit which in treating with two women of no importance makes each of them believe that it is she alone who is seriously loved had spoken to mme bontemps of the duchesse de vendôme as of a person whom it was clearly laid down that she must meet at dinner yes we are determined to have the princess here with the cottards said mme swann a few weeks later my husband thinks that we might get something quite amusing out of that conjunction for if she had retained from the little nucleus certain habits dear to mme verdurin such as that of shouting things aloud so as to be heard by all the faithful she made use at the same time of certain expressions such as conjunction which were dear to the guermantes circle of which she thus felt unconsciously and at a distance as the sea is swayed by the moon the attraction though without being drawn perceptibly closer to it yes the cottards and the duchesse de vendôme do not you think that might be rather fun asked swann i think they will be exceedingly illassorted and it can only lead to a lot of bother people ought not to play with fire is what i say snapped mme bontemps furious she and her husband were all the same invited as was the prince dagrigente to this dinner which mme bontemps and cottard had each two alternative ways of describing according to whom they were telling about it to one set mme bontemps for her part and cottard for his would say casually when asked who else had been of the party only the prince dagrigente it was all quite intimate but there were others who might alas be better informed once indeed some one had challenged cottard with but were not the bontemps there too oh i forgot them cottard had blushingly admitted to the tactless questioner whom he ever afterwards classified among slanderers and speakers of evil for these the bontemps and cottards had each adopted without any mutual arrangement a version the framework of which was identical for both parties their own names alone changing places let me see cottard would say there were our host and hostess the due and duchesse de vendôme with a satisfied smile professor and mme cottard and upon my soul heaven only knows how they got there for they were about as much in keeping as hairs in the soup m and mme bontemps mme bontemps would recite an exactly similar piece only it was m and mme bontemps who were named with a satisfied emphasis between the duchesse de vendôme and the prince dagrigente while the also ran whom finally she used to accuse of having invited themselves and who completely spoiled the party were the cottards when he had been paying calls swann would often come home with little time to spare before dinner at that point in the evening six of the clock when in the old days he had felt so wretched he no longer asked himself what odette might be about and was hardly at all concerned to hear that she had people still with her or had gone out he recalled at times that he had once years ago tried to read through its envelope a letter addressed by odette to forcheville but this memory was not pleasing to him and rather than plumb the depth of shame that he felt in it he preferred to indulge in a little grimace twisting up the corners of his mouth and adding if need be a shake of the head which signified what does it all matter in truth he considered now that the hypothesis by which he had often been brought to a standstill in days gone by according to which it was his jealous imagination alone that blackened what was in reality the innocent life of odette that this hypothesis which after all was beneficent since so long as his amorous malady had lasted it had diminished his sufferings by making them seem imaginary was not the truth that it was his jealousy that had seen things in the right light and that if odette had loved him better than he supposed she had deceived him more as well formerly while his sufferings were still keen he had vowed that as soon as he should have ceased to love odette and so to be afraid either of vexing her or of making her believe that he loved her more than he did he would afford himself the satisfaction of elucidating with her simply from his love of truth and as a historical point whether or not she had had forcheville in her room that day when he had rung her bell and rapped on her window without being let in and she had written to forcheville that it was an uncle of hers who had called but this so interesting problem of which he was waiting to attempt the solution only until his jealousy should have subsided had precisely lost all interest in swanns eyes when he had ceased to be jealous not immediately however he felt no other jealousy now with regard to odette than what the memory of that day that afternoon spent in knocking vainly at the little house in the rue la pérouse had continued to excite in him as though his jealousy not dissimilar in that respect from those maladies which appear to have their seat their centre of contagion less in certain persons than in certain places in certain houses had had for its object not so much odette herself as that day that hour in the irrevocable past when swann had beaten at every entrance to her house in turn you would have said that that day that hour alone had caught and preserved a few last fragments of the amorous personality which had once been swanns and that there alone could he now recapture them for a long time now it had made no matter to him that odette had been false to him and was false still and yet he had continued for some years to seek out old servants of odette so strongly in him persisted the painful curiosity to know whether on that day so long ago at six of the clock odette had been in bed with forcheville then that curiosity itself had disappeared without however his abandoning his investigations he continued the attempt to discover what no longer interested him because his old ego though it had shrivelled to the extreme of decrepitude still acted mechanically following the course of preoccupations so utterly abandoned that swann could not now succeed even in forming an idea of that anguish so compelling once that he had been unable to foresee his ever being delivered from it that only the death of her whom he loved death which as will be shewn later on in this story by a cruel example in no way diminishes the sufferings caused by jealousy seemed to him capable of making smooth the road then insurmountably barred to him of his life but to bring to light some day those passages in the life of odette to which he owed his sufferings had not been swanns only ambition he had in reserve that also of wreaking vengeance for his sufferings when being no longer in love with odette he should no longer be afraid of her and the opportunity of gratifying this second ambition had just occurred for swann was in love with another woman a woman who gave him grounds for jealousy no but who did all the same make him jealous because he was not capable now of altering his way of making love and it was the way he had used with odette that must serve him now for another to make swanns jealousy revive it was not essential that this woman should be unfaithful it sufficed that for any reason she was separated from him at a party for instance where she was presumably enjoying herself that was enough to reawaken in him the old anguish that lamentable and inconsistent excrescence of his love which held swann ever at a distance from what she really was like a yearning to attain the impossible what this young woman really felt for him the hidden longing that absorbed her days the secret places of her heart for between swann and her whom he loved this anguish piled up an unyielding mass of already existing suspicions having their because in odette or in some other perhaps who had preceded odette allowing this now ageing lover to know his mistress of the moment only in the traditional and collective phantasm of the woman who made him jealous in which he had arbitrarily incarnated his new love often however swann would charge his jealousy with the offence of making him believe in imaginary infidelities but then he would remember that he had given odette the benefit of the same argument and had in that been wrong and so everything that the young woman whom he loved did in those hours when he was not with her appeared spoiled of its innocence in his eyes but whereas at that other time he had made a vow that if ever he ceased to love her whom he did not then imagine to be his future wife he would implacably exhibit to her an indifference that would at length be sincere so as to avenge his pride that had so long been trampled upon by her of those reprisals which he might now enforce without risk to himself for what harm could it do him to be taken at his word and deprived of those intimate moments with odette that had been so necessary to him once of those reprisals he took no more thought with his love had vanished the desire to shew that he was in love no longer and he who when he was suffering at the hands of odette would have looked forward so keenly to letting her see one day that he had fallen to a rival now that he was in a position to do so took infinite precautions lest his wife should suspect the existence of this new love it was not only in those teaparties on account of which i had formerly had the sorrow of seeing gilberte leave me and go home earlier than usual that i was henceforth to take part but the engagements that she had with her mother to go for a walk or to some afternoon party which by preventing her from coming to the champselysées had deprived me of her on those days when i loitered alone upon the lawn or stood before the wooden horses to these outings m and mme swann henceforth admitted me i had a seat in their landau and indeed it was me that they asked if i would rather go to the theatre to a dancing lesson at the house of one of gilbertes friends to some social gathering given by friends of her parents what odette called a little meeting or to visit the tombs at saintdenis on days when i was going anywhere with the swanns i would arrive at the house in time for déjeuner which mme swann called le lunch as one was not expected before halfpast twelve while my parents in those days had their meal at a quarter past eleven it was not until they had risen from the table that i made my way towards that sumptuous quarter deserted enough at any hour but more particularly just then when everyone had gone indoors even on winter days of frost if the weather held tightening every few minutes the knot of a gorgeous necktie from charvets and looking to see that my varnished boots were not getting dirty i would roam to and fro among the avenues waiting until twentyseven minutes past the hour i could see from afar in the swanns little gardenplot the sunlight glittering like hoar frost from the bareboughed trees it is true that the garden boasted but a pair of them the unusual hour presented the scene in a new light into these pleasures of nature intensified by the suppression of habit and indeed by my physical hunger the thrilling prospect of sitting down to luncheon with mme swann was infused it did not diminish them but taking command of them trained them to its service so that if at this hour when ordinarily i did not perceive them i seemed now to be discovering the fine weather the cold the wintry sunlight it was all as a sort of preface to the creamed eggs as a patina a cool and coloured glaze applied to the decoration of that mystic chapel which was the habitation of mme swann and in the heart of which there were by contrast so much warmth so many scents and flowers at halfpast twelve i would finally make up my mind to enter that house which like an immense christmas stocking seemed ready to bestow upon me supernatural delights the french name noël was by the way unknown to mme swann and gilberte who had substituted for it the english christmas and would speak of nothing but christmas pudding what people had given them as christmas presents and of going away the thought of which maddened me with grief for christmas at home even i should have thought it degrading to use the word noël and always said christmas which my father considered extremely silly i encountered no one at first but a footman who after leading me through several large drawingrooms shewed me into one that was quite small empty its windows beginning to dream already in the blue light of afternoon i was left alone there in the company of orchids roses and violets which like people who are kept waiting in a room beside you but do not know you preserved a silence which their individuality as living things made all the more impressive and received coldly the warmth of a glowing fire of coals preciously displayed behind a screen of crystal in a basin of white marble over which it spilled now and again its perilous rubies i had sat down but i rose hurriedly on hearing the door opened it was only another footman and then a third and the minute result chat their vainly alarming entrances and exits achieved was to put a little more coal on the fire or water in the vases they departed i found myself alone once that door was shut which mme swann was surely soon going to open of a truth i should have been less ill at ease in a magicians cave than in this little waitingroom where the fire appeared to me to be performing alchemical transmutations as in klingsors laboratory footsteps sounded afresh i did not rise it was sure to be just another footman it was m swann what all by yourself what is one to do that poor wife of mine has never been able to remember what time means ten minutes to one she gets later every day and you will see she will come sailing in without the least hurry and imagine she is in heaps of time and as he was still subject to neuritis and as he was becoming a trifle ridiculous the fact of possessing so unpunctual a wife who came in so late from the bois forgot everything at her dressmakers and was never in time for luncheon made swann anxious for his digestion but flattered his selfesteem he shewed me his latest acquisitions and explained their interest to me but my emotion added to the unfamiliarity of being still without food at this hour sweeping through my mind left it void so that while able to speak i was incapable of hearing anyhow so far as the works of art in swanns possession were concerned it was enough for me that they were contained in his house formed a part there of the delicious hour that preceded luncheon the gioconda herself might have appeared there without giving me any more pleasure than one of mme swanns indoor gowns or her scent bottles i continued to wait alone or with swann and often with gilberte come in to keep us company the arrival of mme swann prepared for me by all those majestic apparitions must so it seemed to me be something truly immense i strained my ears to catch the slightest sound but one never finds quite as high as one has been expecting a cathedral a wave in a storm a dancers leap in the air after those liveried footmen suggesting the whose processional entry upon the stage leads up to and at the same time diminishes the final appearance of the queen mme swann creeping furtively in with a little otterskin coat her veil lowered to cover a nose pinktipped by the cold did not fulfil the promises lavished while i had been waiting upon my imagination but if she had stayed at home all morning when she arrived in the drawingroom she would be clad in a wrapper of crepedechine brightly coloured which seemed to me more exquisite than any of her dresses sometimes the swanns decided to remain in the house all afternoon and then as we had had luncheon so late very soon i must watch setting beyond the gardenwall the sun of that day which had seemed to me bound to be different from other days then in vain might the servants bring in lamps of every size and shape burning each upon the consecrated altar of a console a cardtable a cornercupboard a bracket as though for the celebration of some strange and secret rite nothing extraordinary transpired in the conversation and i went home disappointed as one often is in ones childhood after the midnight mass but my disappointment was scarcely more than mental i was radiant with happiness in this house where gilberte when she was still not with us was about to appear and would bestow on me in a moment and for hours to come her speech her smiling and attentive gaze just as i had caught it that first time at combray at the most i was a trifle jealous when i saw her so often disappear into vast rooms above reached by a private staircase obliged myself to remain in the drawingroom like a man in love with an actress who is confined to his stall in front and wonders anxiously what is going on behind the scenes in the greenroom i put to swann with regard to this other part of the house questions artfully veiled but in a tone from which i could not quite succeed in banishing the note of uneasiness he explained to me that the place to which gilberte had gone was the linenroom offered himself to shew it to me and promised me that whenever gilberte had occasion to go there again he would insist upon her taking me with her by these last words and the relief which they brought me swann at once annihilated for me one of those terrifying interior perspectives at the end of which a woman with whom we are in love appears so remote at that moment i felt for him an affection which i believed to be deeper than my affection for gilberte for he being the master over his daughter was giving her to me whereas she she withheld herself now and then i had not the same direct control over her as i had indirectly through swann besides it was she whom i loved and could not therefore look upon without that disturbance without that desire for something more which destroys in us in the presence of one whom we love the sensation of loving as a rule however we did not stay indoors we went out sometimes before going to dress mme swann would sit down at the piano her lovely hands escaping from the pink or white or often vividly coloured sleeves of her crepedechine wrapper drooped over the keys with that same melancholy which was in her eyes but was not in her heart it was on one of those days that she happened to play me the part of vinteuils sonata that contained the little phrase of which swann had been so fond but often one listens and hears nothing if it is a piece of music at all complicated to which one is listening for the first time and yet when later on this sonata had been played over to me two or three times i found that i knew it quite well and so it is not wrong to speak of hearing a thing for the first time if one had indeed as one supposes received no impression from the first hearing the second the third would be equally first hearings and there would be no reason why one should understand it any better after the tenth probably what is wanting the first time is not comprehension but memory for our memory compared to the complexity of the impressions which it has to face while we are listening is infinitesimal as brief as the memory of a man who in his sleep thinks of a thousand things and at once forgets them or as that of a man in his second childhood who cannot recall a minute afterwards what one has just been saying to him of these multiple impressions our memory is not capable of furnishing us with an immediate picture but that picture gradually takes shape and with regard to works which we have heard more than once we are like the schoolboy who has read several times over before going to sleep a lesson which he supposed himself not to know and finds that he can repeat it by heart next morning it was only that i had not until then heard a note of the sonata whereas swann and his wife could make out a distinct phrase that was as far beyond the range of my perception as a name which one endeavours to recall and in place of which one discovers only a void a void from which an hour later when one is not thinking about them will spring of their own accord in one continuous flight the syllables that one has solicited in vain and not only does one not seize at once and retain an impression of works that are really great but even in the content of any such work as befell me in the case of vinteuils sonata it is the least valuable parts that one at first perceives thus it was that i was mistaken not only in thinking that this work held nothing further in store for me so that for a long time i made no effort to hear it again from the moment in which mme swann had played over to me its most famous passage i was in this respect as stupid as people are who expect to feel no astonishment when they stand in venice before the front of saint marks because photography has already acquainted them with the outline of its domes far more than that even when i had heard the sonata played from beginning to end it remained almost wholly invisible to me like a monument of which its distance or a haze in the atmosphere allows us to catch but a faint and fragmentary glimpse hence the depression inseparable from ones knowledge of such works as of everything that acquires reality in time when the least obvious beauties of vinteuils sonata were revealed to me already borne by the force of habit beyond the reach of my sensibility those that i had from the first distinguished and preferred in it were beginning to escape to avoid me since i was able only in successive moments to enjoy all the pleasures that this sonata gave me i never possessed it in its entirety it was like life itself but less disappointing than life is great works of art do not begin by giving us all their best in vinteuils sonata the beauties that one discovers at once are those also of which one most soon grows tired and for the same reason no doubt namely that they are less different from what one already knows but when those first apparitions have withdrawn there is left for our enjoyment some passage which its composition too new and strange to offer anything but confusion to our mind had made indistinguishable and so preserved intact and this which we have been meeting every day and have not guessed it which has thus been held in reserve for us which by the sheer force of its beauty has become invisible and has remained unknown this comes to us last of all but this also must be the last that we shall relinquish and we shall love it longer than the rest because we have taken longer to get to love it the time moreover that a person requires as i required in the matter of this sonata to penetrate a work of any depth is merely an epitome a symbol one might say of the years the centuries even that must elapse before the public can begin to cherish a masterpiece that is really new so that the man of genius to shelter himself from the ignorant contempt of the world may say to himself that since ones contemporaries are incapable of the necessary detachment works written for posterity should be read by posterity alone like certain pictures which one cannot appreciate when one stands too close to them but as it happens any such cowardly precaution to avoid false judgments is doomed to failure they are inevitable the reason for which a work of genius is not easily admired from the first is that the man who has created it is extraordinary that few other men resemble him it was beethovens quartets themselves the twelfth thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth that devoted half a century to forming fashioning and enlarging a public for beethovens quartets marking in this way like every great work of art an advance if not in artistic merit at least in intellectual society largely composed today of what was not to be found when the work first appeared that is to say of persons capable of enjoying it what artists call posterity is the posterity of the work of art it is essential that the work leaving out of account for brevitys sake the contingency that several men of genius may at the same time be working along parallel lines to create a more instructed public in the future a public from which other men of genius shall reap the benefit shall create its own posterity for if the work were held in reserve were revealed only to posterity that audience for that particular work would be not posterity but a group of contemporaries who were merely living halfacentury later in time and so it is essential that the artist and this is what vinteuil had done if he wishes his work to be free to follow its own course shall launch it wherever he may find sufficient depth confidently outward bound towards the future and yet this interval of time the true perspective in which to behold a work of art if leaving it out of account is the mistake made by bad judges taking it into account is at times a dangerous precaution of the good no doubt one can easily imagine by an illusion similar to that which makes everything on the horizon appear equidistant that all the revolutions which have hitherto occurred in painting or in music did at least shew respect for certain rules whereas that which immediately confronts us be it impressionism a striving after discord an exclusive use of the chinese scale cubism futurism or what you will differs outrageously from all that have occurred before simply because those that have occurred before we are apt to regard as a whole forgetting that a long process of assimilation has melted them into a continuous substance varied of course but taking it as a whole homogeneous in which hugo blends with moliere let us try to imagine the shocking incoherence that we should find if we did not take into account the future and the changes that it must bring about in a horoscope of our own riper years drawn and presented to us in our youth only horoscopes are not always accurate and the necessity when judging a work of art of including the temporal factor in the sum total of its beauty introduces to our way of thinking something as hazardous and consequently as barren of interest as every prophecy the nonfulfilment of which will not at all imply any inadequacy on the prophets part for the power to summon possibilities into existence or to exclude them from it is not necessarily within the competence of genius one may have had genius and yet not have believed in the future of railways or of flight or although a brilliant psychologist in the infidelity of a mistress or of a friend whose treachery persons far less gifted would have foreseen if i did not understand the sonata it enchanted me to hear mme swann play her touch appeared to me like her wrappers like the scent of her staircase her cloaks her chrysanthemums to form part of an individual and mysterious whole in a world infinitely superior to that in which the mind is capable of analysing talent attractive is not it that vinteuil sonata swann asked me the moment when night is darkening among the trees when the arpeggios of the violin call down a cooling dew upon the earth you must admit that it is rather charming it shews all the static side of moonlight which is the essential part it is not surprising that a course of radiant heat such as my wife is taking should act on the muscles since moonlight can prevent the leaves from stirring that is what he expresses so well in that little phrase the bois de boulogne plunged in a cataleptic trance by the sea it is even more striking because you have there the faint response of the waves which of course you can hear quite distinctly since nothing else dares to move in paris it is the other way at the most you may notice unfamiliar lights among the old buildings the sky brightened as though by a colourless and harmless conflagration that sort of vast variety show of which you get a hint here and there but in vinteuils little phrase and in the whole sonata for that matter it is not like that the scene is laid in the bois in the gruppetto you can distinctly hear a voice saying i can almost see to read the paper these words from swann might have falsified later on my impression of the sonata music being too little exclusive to inhibit absolutely what other people suggest that we should find in it but i understood from other words which he let fall that this nocturnal foliage was simply that beneath whose shade in many a restaurant on the outskirts of paris he had listened on many an evening to the little phrase in place of the profound significance that he had so often sought in it what it recalled now to swann were the leafy boughs arranged wreathed painted round about it which it gave him the desire to see again because it seemed to him to be their inner their hidden self as it were their soul was the whole of one spring season which he had not been able to enjoy before not having had feverish and moody as he then was enough strength of body and mind for its enjoyment which as one puts by for an invalid the dainties that he has not been able to eat it had kept in store for him the charm that he had been made to feel by certain evenings in the bois a charm of which vinteuils sonata served to remind him he could not have recaptured by questioning odette although she as well as the little phrase had been his companion there but odette had been merely his companion by his side not as the phrase had been within him and so had seen nothing nor would she had she been a thousand times as comprehending have seen anything of that vision which for no one among us or at least i was long under the impression that this rule admitted no exception can be made externally visible it is rather charming do not you think swann continued that sound can give a reflection like water or glass it is curious too that vinteuils phrase now shews me only the things to which i paid no attention then of my troubles my loves of those days it recalls nothing it has altered all my values charles i do not think that is very polite to me what you are saying not polite really you women are superb i was simply trying to explain to this young man that what the music shews to me at least is not for a moment freewill or in tune with the infinite but shall we say old verdurin in his frock coat in the palmhouse at the jardin dacclimatation hundreds of times without my leaving this room the little phrase has carried me off to dine with it at armenonville gad it is less boring anyhow than having to go there with mme de cambremer mme swann laughed that is a lady who is supposed to have been violently in love with charles she explained in the same tone in which shortly before when we were speaking of vermeer of delft of whose existence i had been surprised to find her conscious she had answered me with i ought to explain that m swann was very much taken up with that painter at the time he was courting me is not that so charles dear you are not to start saying things about mme de cambremer swann checked her secretly flattered but i am only repeating what i have been told besides it seems that she is an extremely clever woman i do not know her myself i believe she is very pushing which surprises me rather in a clever woman but everyone says that she was quite mad about you there is no harm in repeating that swann remained silent as a deafmute which was in a way a confirmation of what she had said and a proof of his own fatuity since what i am playing reminds you of the jardin dacclimatation his wife went on with a playful semblance of being offended we might take him there some day in the carriage if it would amuse him it is lovely there just now and you can recapture your fond impressions which reminds me talking of the jardin dacclimatation do you know this young man thought that we were devotedly attached to a person whom i cut as a matter of fact whenever i possibly can mme blatin i think it is rather crushing for us that she should be taken for a friend of ours just fancy dear dr cottard who never says a harsh word about anyone declares that she is positively contagious a frightful woman the one thing to be said for her is that she is exactly like savonarola she is the very image of that portrait of savonarola by fra bartolomeo this mania which swann had for finding likenesses to people in pictures was defensible for even what we call individual expression is as we so painfully discover when we are in love and would fain believe in the unique reality of the beloved something diffused and general which can be found existing at different periods but if one had listened to swann the processions of the kings of the east already so anachronistic when benozzo gozzoli introduced in their midst various medici would have been even more so since they would have included the portraits of a whole crowd of men contemporaries not of gozzoli but of swann subsequent that is to say not only by fifteen centuries to the nativity but by four more to the painter himself there was not missing from those trains according to swann a single living parisian of any note any more than there was from that act in one of sardous plays in which out of friendship for the author and for the leading lady and also because it was the fashion all the best known men in paris famous doctors politicians barristers amused themselves each on a different evening by walking on but what has she got to do with the jardin dacclimatation everything what you do not suggest that she is got a skyblue behind like the monkeys charles you really are too dreadful i was thinking of what the cingalese said to her do tell him charles it really is a gem oh it is too silly you know mme blatin loves asking people questions in a tone which she thinks friendly but which is really overpowering what our good friends on the thames call patronising interrupted odette exactly well she went the other day to the jardin dacclimatation where they have some blackamoors cingalese i think i heard my wife say she is much better up in ethnology than i am now charles you are not to make fun of poor me i have no intention of making fun i assure you well to continue she went up to one of these black fellows with good morning nigga oh it is too absurd anyhow this classification seems to have displeased the black me nigga he shouted quite furious do not you know to mme blatin me nigga you old cow i do think that is so delightful i adore that story do say it is a good one cannot you see old blatin standing there and hearing him me nigga you old cow i expressed an intense desire to go there and see these cingalese one of whom had called mme blatin an old cow they did not interest me in the least but i reflected that in going to the jardin dacclimatation and again on our way home we should pass along that allée des acacias in which i had loved so once to gaze on mme swann and that perhaps coquelins mulatto friend to whom i had never managed to exhibit myself in the act of saluting her would see me there seated at her side as the victoria swept by during those minutes in which gilberte having gone to get ready was not in the room with us m and mme swann would take delight in revealing to me all the rare virtues of their child and everything that i myself observed seemed to prove the truth of what they said i remarked that as her mother had told me she had not only for her friends but for the servants for the poor the most delicate attentions carefully thought out a desire to give pleasure a fear of causing annoyance translated into all sorts of trifling actions which must often have meant great inconvenience to her she had done some work for our stallkeeper in the champselysées and went out in the snow to give it to her with her own hands so as not to lose a day you have no idea how kindhearted she is she will not let it be seen her father assured me young as she was she appeared far more sensible already than her parents when swann boasted of his wifes grand friends gilberte would turn away and remain silent but without any air of reproaching him for it seemed inconceivable to her that her father could be subjected to the slightest criticism one day when i had spoken to her of mlle vinteuil she said to me i shall never know her for a very good reason and that is that she was not nice to her father by what one hears she gave him a lot of trouble you cannot understand that any more than i can you i am sure you could no more live without your papa than i could which is quite natural after all how can one ever forget a person one has loved all ones life and once when she was making herself particularly endearing to swann as i mentioned this to her when he was out of the room yes poor papa it is the anniversary of his fathers death just now you can understand what he must be feeling you do understand do not you you and i feel the same about things like that so i just try to be a little less naughty than usual but he does not ever think you naughty he thinks you are quite perfect poor papa that is because he is far too good himself but her parents were not content with singing the praises of gilberte that same gilberte who even before i had set eyes on her used to appear to me standing before a church in a landscape of the he de france and later awakening in me not dreams now but memories was embowered always in a hedge of pink hawthorn in the little lane that i took when i was going the méséglise way once when i had asked mme swann and had made an effort to assume the indifferent tone of a friend of the family curious to know the preferences of a child which among all her playmates gilberte liked the best mme swann replied but you ought to know a great deal better than i do you are in her confidence her great favourite her chum as the english say it appears that in a coincidence as perfect as this was when reality is folded over to cover the ideal of which we have so long been dreaming it completely hides that ideal absorbing it in itself as when two geometrical figures that are congruent are made to coincide so that there is but one whereas we would rather so as to give its full significance to our enjoyment preserve for all those separate points of our desire at the very moment in which we succeed in touching them and so as to be quite certain that they are indeed themselves the distinction of being intangible and our thought cannot even reconstruct the old state so as to confront the new with it for it has no longer a clear field the acquaintance that we have made the memory of those first unhopedfor moments the talk to which we have listened are there now to block the passage of our consciousness and as they control the outlets of our memory far more than those of our imagination they react more forcibly upon our past which we are no longer able to visualise without taking them into account than upon the form still unshaped of our future i had been able to believe year after year that the right to visit mme swann was a vague and fantastic privilege to which i should never attain after i had spent a quarter of an hour in her drawingroom it was the period in which i did not yet know her that was become fantastic and vague like a possibility which the realisation of an alternative possibility has made impossible how was i ever to dream again of her diningroom as of an inconceivable place when i could not make the least movement in my mind without crossing the path of that inextinguishable ray cast backwards to infinity even ino my own most distant past by the lobster a laméricaine which i had just been eating and swann must have observed in his own case a similar phenomenon for this house in which he entertained me might be regarded as the place into which had flowed to coincide and be lost in one another not only the ideal dwelling that my imagination had constructed but another still that which his jealous love as inventive as any fantasy of mine had so often depicted to him that dwelling common to odette and himself which had appeared so inaccessible once on evenings when odette had taken him home with forcheville to drink orangeade with her and what had flowed in to be absorbed for him in the walls and furniture of the diningroom in which we now sat down to luncheon was that unhopedfor paradise in which in the old days he could not without a pang imagine that he would one day be saying to their butler those very words is madame ready yet which i now heard him utter with a touch of impatience mingled with selfsatisfaction no more than probably swann himself could i succeed in knowing my own happiness and when gilberte once broke out who would ever have said that the little girl you watched playing prisoners base without daring to speak to her would one day be your greatest friend and you would go to her house whenever you liked she spoke of a change the occurrence of which i could verify only by observing it from without finding no trace of it within myself for it was composed of two separate states on both of which i could not without their ceasing to be distinct from one another succeed in keeping my thoughts fixed at one and the same time and yet this house because it had been so passionately desired by swann must have kept for him some of its attraction if i was to judge by myself for whom it had not lost all its mystery that singular charm in which i had for so long supposed the life of the swanns to be bathed i had not completely exorcised from their house on making my own way into it i had made it that charm recoil overpowered as it must be by the sight of the stranger the pariah that i had been to whom now mme swann pushed forward graciously for him to sit in it an armchair exquisite hostile scandalised but all round me that charm in my memory i can still distinguish is it because on those days on which m and mme swann invited me to luncheon to go out afterwards with them and gilberte i imprinted with my gaze while i sat waiting for them there alone on the carpet the sofas the tables the screens the pictures the idea engraved upon my mind that mme swann or her husband or gilberte was about to enter the room is it because those objects have dwelt ever since in my memory side by side with the swanns and have gradually acquired something of their personal character is it because knowing that the swanns passed their existence among all those things i made of all of them as it were emblems of the private lives of those habits of the swanns from which i had too long been excluded for them not to continue to appear strange to me even when i was allowed the privilege of sharing in them however it may be always when i think of that drawingroom which swann not that the criticism implied on his part any intention to find fault with his wifes taste found so incongruous because while it was still planned and carried out in the style half conservatory half studio which had been that of the rooms in which he had first known odette she had none the less begun to replace in its medley a quantity of the chinese ornaments which she now felt to be rather gimcrack a trifle dowdy by a swarm of little chairs and stools and things upholstered in old louis xiv silks not to mention the works of art brought by swann himself from his house on the quai dorléans it has kept in my memory on the contrary that composite heterogeneous room a cohesion a unity an individual charm never possessed even by the most complete the least spoiled of such collections that the past has bequeathed to us or the most modern alive and stamped with the imprint of a living personality for we alone can by our belief that they have an existence of their own give to certain of the things that we see a soul which they afterwards keep which they develop in our minds all the ideas that i had formed of the hours different from those that exist for other men passed by the swanns in that house which was to their life what the body is to the soul and must give expression to its singularity all those ideas were rearranged amalgamated equally disturbing and indefinite throughout in the arrangement of the furniture the thickness of the carpets the position of the windows the ministrations of the servants when after luncheon we went in the sunshine to drink our coffee in the great bay window of the drawingroom while mme swann was asking me how many lumps of sugar i took it was not only the silkcovered stool which she pushed towards me that emitted with the agonising charm that i had long ago felt first among the pink hawthorn and then beside the clump of laurels in the name of gilberte the hostility that her parents had shewn to me which this little piece of furniture seemed to have so well understood to have so completely shared that i felt myself unworthy and found myself almost reluctant to set my feet on its defenceless cushion a personality a soul was latent there which linked it secretly to the light of two of the clock in the afternoon so different from any other light in the gulf in which there played about our feet its sparkling tide of gold out of which the bluish crags of sofas and vaporous carpet beaches emerged like enchanted islands and there was nothing even to the painting by rubens hung above the chimneypiece that was not endowed with the same quality and almost the same intensity of charm as the laced boots of m swann and that hooded cape the like of which i had so dearly longed to wear whereas now odette would beg her husband to go and put on another so as to appear more smart whenever i did them the honour of driving out with them she too went away to change her dress not heeding my protestations that no outdoor clothes could be nearly so becoming as the marvellous garment of crepedechine or silk old rose cherrycoloured tiepolo pink white mauve green red or yellow plain or patterned in which mme swann had sat down to luncheon and which she was now going to take off when i assured her that she ought to go out in that costume she laughed either in scorn of my ignorance or from delight in my compliment she apologised for having so many wrappers explaining that they were the only kind of dress in which she felt comfortable and left us to go and array herself in one of those regal toilets which imposed their majesty on all beholders and yet among which i was sometimes summoned to decide which of them i preferred that she should put on in the jardin dacclimatation how proud i was when we had left the carriage to be walking by the side of mme swann while she strolled carelessly on letting her cloak stream on the air behind her i kept eyeing her with an admiring gaze to which she coquettishly responded in a lingering smile and now were we to meet one or other of gilbertes friends boy or girl who saluted us from afar i would in my turn be looked upon by them as one of those happy creatures whose lot i had envied one of those friends of gilberte who knew her family and had a share in that other part of her life the part which was not spent in the champselysées often upon the paths of the bois or the jardin we passed we were greeted by some great lady who was swanns friend whom he perchance did not see so that his wife must rally him with a charles do not you see mme de montmorency and swann with that amicable smile bred of a long and intimate friendship bared his head but with a slow sweeping gesture with a grace peculiarly his own sometimes the lady would stop glad of an opportunity to shew mme swann a courtesy which would involve no tiresome consequences by which they all knew that she would never seek to profit so thoroughly had swann trained her in reserve she had none the less acquired all the manners of polite society and however smart however stately the lady might be mme swann was invariably a match for her halting for a moment before the friend whom her husband had recognised and was addressing she would introduce us gilberte and myself with so much ease of manner would remain so free so tranquil in her exercise of courtesy that it would have been hard to say looking at them both which of the two was the aristocrat the day on which we went to inspect the cingalese on our way home we saw coming in our direction and followed by two others who seemed to be acting as her escort an elderly but still attractive woman cloaked in a dark mantle and capped with a little bonnet tied beneath her chin with a pair of ribbons ah here is someone who will interest you said swann the old lady who had come within a few yards of us now smiled at us with a caressing sweetness swann doffed his hat mme swann swept to the ground in a curtsey and made as if to kiss the hand of the lady who standing there like a winterhalter portrait drew her up again and kissed her cheek there there will you put your hat on you she scolded swann in a thick and almost growling voice speaking like an old and familiar friend i am going to present you to her imperial highness mme swann whispered swann drew me aside for a moment while his wife talked of the weather and of the animals recently added to the jardin dacclimatation with the princess that is the princesse mathilde he told me you know who i mean the friend of flaubert saintebeuve dumas just fancy she is the niece of napoleon i she had offers of marriage from napoleon iii and the emperor of russia is not that interesting talk to her a little but i hope she will not keep us standing here for an hour i met taine the other day he went on addressing the princess and he told me that your highness was vexed with him he is behaved like a perfect peeg she said gruffly pronouncing the word cochon as though she referred to joan of arcs contemporary bishop cauchon after his article on the emperor i left my card on him with p p c on it i felt the surprise that one feels on opening the correspondence of that duchesse dorléans who was by birth a princess palatine and indeed princesse mathilde animated by sentiments so entirely french expressed them with a straightforward bluntness that recalled the germany of an older generation and was inherited doubtless from her wuerttemberg mother this somewhat rude and almost masculine frankness she softened as soon as she began to smile with an italian languor and the whole person was clothed in a dress so typically second empire that for all that the princess wore it simply and solely no doubt from attachment to the fashions that she had loved when she was young she seemed to have deliberately planned to avoid the slightest discrepancy in historic colour and to be satisfying the expectations of those who looked to her to evoke the memory of another age i whispered to swann to ask her whether she had known musset very slightly sir was the answer given in a tone which seemed to feign annoyance at the question and of course it was by way of a joke that she called swann sir since they were intimate friends i had him to dine once i had invited him for seven of the clock at halfpast seven as he had not appeared we sat down to dinner he arrived at eight bowed to me took his seat never opened his lips went off after dinner without letting me hear the sound of his voice of course he was dead drunk that hardly encouraged me to make another attempt we were standing a little way off swann and i i hope this little audience is not going to last much longer he muttered the soles of my feet are hurting i cannot think why my wife keeps on making conversation when we get home it will be she that complains of being tired and she knows i simply cannot go on standing like this for mme swann who had had the news from mme bontemps was in the course of telling the princess that the government having at last begun to realise the depth of its depravity had decided to send her an invitation to be present on the platform in a few days time when the tsar nicholas was to visit the invalides but the princess who in spite of appearances in spite of the character of her circle which consisted mainly of artists and literary people had remained at heart and shewed herself whenever she had to take action the niece of napoleon replied yes madame i received it this morning and i sent it back to the minister who must have had it by now i told him that i had no need of an invitation to go to the invalides if the government desires my presence there it will not be on the platform it will be in our vault where the emperors tomb is i have no need of a card to admit me there i have my keys i go in and out when i choose the government has only to let me know whether it wishes me to be present or not but if i do go to the invalides it will be down below there or nowhere at all at that moment we were saluted mme swann and i by a young man who greeted her without stopping and whom i was not aware that she knew it was bloch i inquired about him and was told that he had been introduced to her by mme bontemps and that he was employed in the ministers secretariat which was news to me anyhow she could not have seen him often or perhaps she had not cared to utter the name hardly smart enough for her liking of bloch for she told me that he was called m moreul i assured her that she was mistaken that his name was bloch the princess gathered up the train that flowed out behind her while mme swann gazed at it with admiring eyes it is only a fur that the emperor of russia sent me she explained and as i have just been to see him i put it on so as to shew him that i would managed to have it made up as a mantle i hear that prince louis has joined the russian army the princess will be very sad at losing him went on mme swann not noticing her husbands signals of distress that was a fine thing to do as i said to him just because there is been a soldier before in the family that is no reason replied the princess alluding with this abrupt simplicity to napoleon the great but swann could hold out no longer madam it is i that am going to play the prince and ask your permission to retire but you see my wife has not been so well and i do not like her to stand still for any time mme swann curtseyed again and the princess conferred upon us all a celestial smile which she seemed to have summoned out of the past from among the graces of her girlhood from the evenings at compiegne a smile which glided sweet and unbroken over her hitherto so sullen face then she went on her way followed by the two ladies in waiting who had confined themselves in the manner of interpreters of childrens or invalids nurses to punctuating our conversation with insignificant sentences and superfluous explanations you should go and write your name in her book one day this week mme swann counselled me one does not leave cards upon these royalties as the english call them but she will invite you to her house if you put your name down sometimes in those last days of winter we would go before proceeding on our expedition into one of the small pictureshows that were being given at that time where swann as a collector of mark was greeted with special deference by the dealers in whose galleries they were held and in that still wintry weather the old longing to set out for the south of france and venice would be reawakened in me by those rooms in which a springtime already well advanced and a blazing sun cast violet shadows upon the roseate alpilles and gave the intense transparency of emeralds to the grand canal if the weather were inclement we would go to a concert or a theatre and afterwards to one of the fashionable tearooms there whenever mme swann had anything to say to me which she did not wish the people at the next table or even the waiters who brought our tea to understand she would say it in english as though that had been a secret language known to our two selves alone as it happened everyone in the place knew english i only had not yet learned the language and was obliged to say so to mme swann in order that she might cease to make on the people who were drinking tea or were serving us with it remarks which i guessed to be uncomplimentary without either my understanding or the person referred to losing a single word once in the matter of an afternoon at the theatre gilberte gave me a great surprise it was precisely the day of which she had spoken to me some time back on which fell the anniversary of her grandfathers death we were to go she and i with her governess to hear selections from an opera and gilberte had dressed with a view to attending this performance and wore the air of indifference with which she was in the habit of treating whatever we might be going to do with the comment that it might be anything in the world no matter what provided that it amused me and had her parents approval before luncheon her mother drew us aside to tell us that her father was vexed at the thought of our going to a theatre on that day this seemed to me only natural gilberte remained impassive but grew pale with an anger which she was unable to conceal still she uttered not a word when m swann joined us his wife took him to the other end of the room and said something in his ear he called gilberte and they went together into the next room we could hear their raised voices and yet i could not bring myself to believe that gilberte so submissive so loving so thoughtful would resist her fathers appeal on such a day and for so trifling a matter at length swann reappeared with her saying you heard what i said now you may do as you like gilbertes features remained compressed in a frown throughout luncheon after which we retired to her room then suddenly without hesitating and as though she had never at any point hesitated over her course of action two of the clock she exclaimed you know the concert begins at half past and she told her governess to make haste but i reminded her will not your father be cross with you not the least little bit surely he was afraid it would look odd because of the anniversary what difference can it make to me what people think i think it is perfectly absurd to worry about other people in matters of sentiment we feel things for ourselves not for the public mademoiselle has very few pleasures she is been looking forward to going to this concert i am not going to deprive her of it just to satisfy public opinion but gilberte i protested taking her by the arm it is not to satisfy public opinion it is to please your father you are not going to pass remarks upon my conduct i hope she said sharply plucking her arm away a favour still more precious than their taking me with them to the jardin dacclimatation the swanns did not exclude me even from their friendship with bergotte which had been at the root of the attraction that i had found in them when before i had even seen gilberte i reflected that her intimacy with that godlike elder would have made her for me the most passionately enthralling of friends had not the disdain that i was bound to inspire in her forbidden me to hope that she would ever take me in his company to visit the towns that he loved and lo one day came an invitation from mme swann to a big luncheonparty i did not know who else were to be the guests on my arrival i was disconcerted as i crossed the hall by an alarming incident mme swann seldom missed an opportunity of adopting any of those customs which pass as fashionable for a season and then failing to find support are speedily abandoned as for instance many years before she had had her private hansom or now had printed in english upon a card inviting you to luncheon the words to meet followed by the name of some more or less important personage often enough these usages implied nothing mysterious and required no initiation take for instance a minute innovation of those days imported from england odette had made her husband have some visiting cards printed on which the name charles swann was preceded by mr after the first visit that i paid her mme swann had left at my door one of these pasteboards as she called them no one had ever left a card on me before i felt at once so much pride emotion gratitude that scraping together all the money i possessed i ordered a superb basket of camellias and had it sent to mme swann i implored my father to go and leave a card on her but first quickly to have some printed on which his name should bear the prefix mr he vouchsafed neither of my prayers i was in despair for some days and then asked myself whether he might not after all have been right but this use of mr if it meant nothing was at least intelligible not so with another that was revealed to me on the occasion of this luncheonparty but revealed without any indication of its purport at the moment when i was about to step from the hall into the drawingroom the butler handed me a thin oblong envelope upon which my name was inscribed in my surprise i thanked him but i eyed the envelope with misgivings i no more knew what i was expected to do with it than a foreigner knows what to do with one of those little utensils that they lay by his place at a chinese banquet i noticed that it was gummed down i was afraid of appearing indiscreet were i to open it then and there and so i thrust it into my pocket with an air of knowing all about it mme swann had written to me a few days before asking me to come to luncheon with just a few people there were however sixteen of us among whom i never suspected for a moment that i was to find bergotte mme swann who had already named me as she called it to several of her guests suddenly after my name in the same tone that she had used in uttering it in fact as though we were merely two of the guests at her party who ought each to feel equally flattered on meeting the other pronounced that of the sweet singer with the snowy locks the name bergotte made me jump like the sound of a revolver fired at me point blank but instinctively for appearances sake i bowed there straight in front of me as by one of those conjurers whom we see standing whole and unharmed in their frock coats in the smoke of a pistol shot out of which a pigeon has just fluttered my salute was returned by a young common little thickset peering person with a red nose curled like a snailshe will and a black tuft on his chin i was cruelly disappointed for what had just vanished in the dust of the explosion was not only the feeble old man of whom no vestige now remained there was also the beauty of an immense work which i had contrived to enshrine in the frail and hallowed organism that i had constructed like a temple expressly for itself but for which no room was to be found in the squat figure packed tight with bloodvessels bones muscles sinews of the little man with the snub nose and black beard who stood before me all the bergotte whom i had slowly and delicately elaborated for myself drop by drop like a stalactite out of the transparent beauty of his books ceased i could see at once to be of any use the moment i was obliged to include in him the snailshe will nose and to utilise the little black beard just as we must reject as worthless the solution of a problem the terms of which we have not read in full having failed to observe that the total must amount to a specified figure the nose and beard were elements similarly ineluctable and all the more aggravating in that while forcing me to reconstruct entirely the personage of bergotte they seemed further to imply to produce to secrete incessantly a certain quality of mind alert and selfsatisfied which was not in the picture for such a mind had no connexion whatever with the sort of intelligence that was diffused throughout those books so intimately familiar to me which were permeated by a gentle and godlike wisdom starting from them i should never have arrived at that snailshe will nose but starting from the nose which did not appear to be in the slightest degree ashamed of itself but stood out alone there like a grotesque ornament fastened on his face i must proceed in a diametrically opposite direction from the work of bergotte i must arrive it would seem at the mentality of a busy and preoccupied engineer of the sort who when you accost him in the street thinks it correct to say thanks and you before you have actually inquired of them how they are or else if you assure them that you have been charmed to make their acquaintance respond with an abbreviation which they imagine to be effective intelligent and uptodate inasmuch as it avoids any waste of precious time on vain formalities same here names are no doubt but whimsical draughtsmen giving us of people as well as of places sketches so little like the reality that we often experience a kind of stupor when we have before our eyes in place of the imagined the visible world which for that matter is not the true world our senses being little more endowed than our imagination with the art of portraiture so little indeed that the final and approximately lifelike pictures which we manage to obtain of reality are at least as different from the visible world as that was from the imagined but in bergottes case my preconceived idea of him from his name troubled me far less than my familiarity with his work to which i was obliged to attach as to the cord of a balloon the man with the little beard without knowing whether it would still have the strength to raise him from the ground it seemed quite clear however that it really was he who had written the books that i had so greatly enjoyed for mme swann having thought it incumbent upon her to tell him of my admiration for one of these he shewed no surprise that she should have mentioned this to him rather than to any other of the party nor did he seem to regard her action as due to a misapprehension but swelling out the frock coat which he had put on in honour of all these distinguished guests with a body distended in anticipation of the coming meal while his mind was completely occupied by other more real and more important considerations it was only as at some finished episode in his early life as though one had made an illusion to a costume of the duc de guise which he had worn one season at a fancy dress ball that he smiled as he bore his mind back to the idea of his books which at once began to fall in my estimation dragging down with them the whole value of beauty of the world of life itself until they seemed to have been merely the casual amusement of a man with a little beard i told myself that he must have taken great pains over them but that if he had lived upon an island surrounded by beds of pearloysters he would instead have devoted himself to and would have made a fortune out of the pearling trade his work no longer appeared to me so inevitable and then i asked myself whether originality did indeed prove that great writers were gods ruling each one over a kingdom that was his alone or whether all that was not rather makebelieve whether the differences between one mans book and anothers were not the result of their respective labours rather than the expression of a radical and essential difference between two contrasted personalities meanwhile we had taken our places at the table by the side of my plate i found a carnation the stalk of which was wrapped in silver paper it embarrassed me less than the envelope that had been handed to me in the hall which however i had completely forgotten this custom strange as it was to me became more intelligible when i saw all the male guests take up the similar carnations that were lying by their plates and slip them into the buttonholes of their coats i did as they had done with the air of spontaneity that a freethinker assumes in church who is not familiar with the order of service but rises when everyone else rises and kneels a moment after everyone else is on his knees another usage equally strange to me but less ephemeral disquieted me more on the other side of my plate was a smaller plate on which was heaped a blackish substance which i did not then know to be caviare i was ignorant of what was to be done with it but firmly determined not to let it enter my mouth bergotte was sitting not far from me and i could hear quite well everything that he said i understood then the impression that m de norpois had formed of him he had indeed a peculiar organ there is nothing that so much alters the material qualities of the voice as the presence of thought behind what one is saying the resonance of ones diphthongs the energy of ones labials are profoundly affected in fact ones whole way of speaking his seemed to me to differ entirely from his way of writing and even the things that he said from those with which he filled his books but the voice issues from behind a mask through which it is not powerful enough to make us recognise at first sight a face which we have seen uncovered in the speakers literary style at certain pobts in the conversation when bergotte by force of habit began to talk in a way which no one but m de norpois would have thought affected or unpleasant it was a long time before i discovered an exact correspondence with the parts of his books in which his form became so poetic and so musical at those points i could see in what he was saying a plastic beauty independent of whatever his sentences might mean and as human speech reflects the human soul though without expressing it as does literary style bergotte appeared almost to be talking nonsense intoning certain words and if he were secretly pursuing beneath them a single image stringing them together uninterruptedly on one continuous note with a wearisome monotony so that a pretentious emphatic and monotonous opening was a sign of the rare aesthetic value of what he was saying and an effect in his conversation of the same power which in his books produced that harmonious flow of imagery i had had all the more difficulty in discovering this at first since what he said at such moments precisely because it was the authentic utterance of bergotte had not the appearance of being bergottes it was an abundant crop of clearly defined ideas not included in that bergotte manner which so many storytellers had appropriated to themselves and this dissimilarity was probably but another aspect made out with difficulty through the stream of conversation as an eclipse is seen through a smoked glass of the fact that when one read a page of bergotte it was never just what would have been written by any of those lifeless imitators who nevertheless in newspapers and in books adorned their prose with so many bergottish images and ideas this difference in style arose from the fact that what was meant by bergottism was first and foremost a priceless element of truth hidden in the heart of everything whence it was extracted by that great writer by virtue of his genius and that this extraction and not simply the perpetration of bergottisms was my sweet singers aim in writing though it must be added he continued to perpetrate them in spite of himself and because he was bergotte so that in one sense every fresh beauty in his work was the little drop of bergotte buried at the heart of a thing which he had distilled from it but if for that reason each of those beauties was related to all the rest and had a family likeness yet each remained separate and individual as was the act of discovery that had brought it to the light of day new and consequently different from what was called the bergotte manner which was a loose synthesis of all the bergottisms already invented and set forth by him in writing with no indication by which men who lacked genius might forecast what would be his next discovery so it is with all great writers the beauty of their language is as incalculable as that of a woman whom we have never seen it is creative because it is applied to an external object of which and not of their language or its beauty they are thinking to which they have not yet given expression an author of memorials of our time wishing to write without too obviously seeming to be writing like saintsimon might on occasion give us the first line of his portrait of villars he was a rather tall man dark with an alert open expressive physiognomy but what law of determinism could bring him to the discovery of saintsimons next line which begins with and to tell the truth a trifle mad the true variety is in this abundance of real and unexpected elements in the branch loaded with blue flowers which thrusts itself forward against all reason from the spring hedgerow that seemed already overcharged with blossoms whereas the purely formal imitation of variety and one might advance the same argument for all the other qualities of style is but a barren uniformity that is to say the very antithesis of variety and cannot in the work of imitators give the illusion or recall other examples of variety save to a reader who has not acquired the sense of it from the masters themselves and so just as bergottes way of speaking would no doubt have been charming if he himself had been merely an amateur repeating imitations of bergotte whereas it was attached to the mind of bergotte at work and in action by essential ties which the ear did not at once distinguish so it was because bergotte applied that mind with precision to the reality which pleased him that his language had in it something positive something overrich disappointing those who expected to hear him speak only of the eternal torrent of forms and of the mystic thrills of beauty moreover the quality always rare and new of what he wrote was expressed in his conversation by so subtle a manner of approaching a question ignoring every aspect of it that was already familiar that he appeared to be seizing hold of an unimportant detail to be quite wrong about it to be speaking in paradox so that his ideas seemed as often as not to be in confusion for each of us finds lucidity only in those ideas which are in the same state of confusion as his own besides as all novelty depends upon the elimination first of the stereotyped attitude to which we have grown accustomed and which has seemed to us to be reality itself every new conversation as well as all original painting and music must always appear laboured and tedious it is founded upon figures of speech with which we are not familiar the speaker appears to us to be talking entirely in metaphors and this wearies us and gives us the impression of a want of truth after all the old forms of speech must in their time have been images difficult to follow when the listener was not yet cognisant of the uni which they depicted but he has long since decided that this must be the real uni and so relies confidently upon it so when bergotte and his figures appear simple enough today said of cottard that he was a mannikin in a bottle always trying to rise to the surface and of brichot that to him even more than to mme swann the arrangement of his hair was a matter for anxious deliberation because in his twofold preoccupation over his profile and his reputation he had always to make sure that it was so brushed as to give him the air at once of a lion and of a philosopher one immediately felt the strain and sought a foothold upon something which one called more concrete meaning by that more ordinary these unintelligible words issuing from the mask that i had before my eyes it was indeed to the writer whom i admired that they must be attributed and yet they could not have been inserted among his books in the form of a puzzle set in a series of different puzzles they occupied another plane and required a transposition by means of which one day when i was repeating to myself certain phrases that i had heard bergotte use i discovered in them the whole machinery of his literary style the different elements of which i was able to recognise and to name in this spoken discourse which had struck me as being so different from a less immediate point of view the special way a little too meticulous too intense that he had of pronouncing certain words certain adjectives which were constantly recurring in his conversation and which he never uttered without a certain emphasis giving to each of their syllables a separate force and intoning the last syllable as for instance the word visage which he always used in preference to figure and enriched with a number of superfluous vs and ss and gs which seemed all to explode from his outstretched palm at such moments corresponded exactly to the fine passages in which in his prose he brought those favourite words into the light preceded by a sort of margin and composed in such a way in the metrical whole of the phrase that the reader was obliged if he were not to make a false quantity to give to each of them its full value and yet one did not find in the speech of bergotte a certain luminosity which in his books as in those of some other writers often modified in the written phrase the appearance of its words this was doubtless because that light issues from so profound a depth that its rays do not penetrate to our spoken words in the hours in which thrown open to others by the act of conversation we are to a certain extent closed against ourselves in this respect there were more intonations there was more accent in his books than in his talk an accent independent of the beauty of style which the author himself has possibly not perceived for it is not separable from his most intimate personality it was this accent which at the moments when in his books bergotte was entirely natural gave a rhythm to the words often at such times quite insignificant that he wrote this accent is not marked on the printed page there is nothing there to indicate it and yet it comes of its own accord to his phrases one cannot pronounce them in any other way it is what was most ephemeral and at the same time most profound in the writer and it is what will bear witness to his true nature what will say whether despite all the austerity that he has expressed he was gentle despite all his sensuality sentimental certain peculiarities of elocution faint traces of which were to be found in bergottes conversation were not exclusively his own for when later on i came to know his brothers and sisters i found those peculiarities much more accentuated in their speech there was something abrupt and harsh in the closing words of a light and spirited utterance something faint and dying at the end of a sad one swann who had known the master as a boy told me that in those days one used to hear on his lips just as much as on his brothers and sisters those inflexions almost a family type shouts of violent merriment interspersed with murmurings of a longdrawn melancholy and that in the room in which they all played together he used to perform his part better than any of them in their symphonies alternately deafening and subdued however characteristic it may be the sound that escapes from human lips is fugitive and does not survive the speaker but it was not so with the pronunciation of the bergotte family for if it is difficult ever to understand even in the meistersinger how an artist can invent music by listening to the twittering of birds yet bergotte had transposed and fixed in his written language that manner of dwelling on words which repeat themselves in shouts of joy or fall drop by drop in melancholy sighs there are in his books just such closing phrases where the accumulated sounds are prolonged as in the last chords of the overture of an opera which cannot come to an end and repeats several times over its supreme cadence before the conductor finally lays down his baton in which later on i was to find a musical equivalent for those phonetic brasses of the bergotte family but in his own case from the moment in which he transferred them to his books he ceased instinctively to make use of them in his speech from the day on which he had begun to write all the more markedly therefore in the later years in which i first knew him his voice had lost this orchestration for ever these young bergottes the future writer and his brothers and sisters were doubtless in no way superior far from it to other young people more refined more intellectual than themselves who found the bergottes rather loud that is to say a trifle vulgar irritating one by the witticisms which characterised the tone at once pretentious and puerile of their household but genius and even what is only great talent springs less from seeds of intellect and social refinement superior to those of other people than from the faculty of transposing and so transforming them to heat a liquid over an electric lamp one requires to have not the strongest lamp possible but one of which the current can cease to illuminate can be diverted so as instead of light to give heat to mount the skies it is not necessary to have the most powerful of motors one must have a motor which instead of continuing to run along the earths surface intersecting with a vertical line the horizontal which it began by following is capable of converting its speed into ascending force similarly the men who produce works of genius are not those who live in the most delicate atmosphere whose conversation is most brilliant or their culture broadest but those who have had the power ceasing in a moment to live only for themselves to make use of their personality as of a mirror m such a way that their life however unimportant it may be socially and even in a sense intellectually speaking is reflected by it genius consisting in the reflective power of the writer and not in the intrinsic quality of the scene reflected the day on which young bergotte succeeded in shewing to the world of his readers the tasteless household in which he had passed his childhood and the not very amusing conversations between himself and his brothers on that day he climbed far above the friends of his family more intellectual and more distinguished than himself they in their fine rolls royces might return home expressing due contempt for the vulgarity of the bergottes but he with his modest engine which had at last left the ground he soared above their heads but there were other characteristics of his elocution which it was not with the members of his family but with certain contemporary writers that he must share younger men who were beginning to repudiate him as a master and disclaimed any intellectual affinity to him in themselves displayed their affinity without knowing it when they made use of the same adverbs the same prepositions that he incessantly repeated when they constructed their sentences in the same way spoke in the same quiescent lingering tone by a reaction from the eloquent easy language of an earlier generation perhaps these young men we shall come across some of whom this may be said had never known bergotte but his way of thinking inoculated into them had led them to those alterations of syntax and of accent which bear a necessary relation to originality of mind a relation which incidentally requires to be traced thus bergotte if he owed nothing to any man for his manner of writing derived his manner of speaking from one of his early associates a marvellous talker to whose ascendancy he had succumbed whom he imitated unconsciously in his conversation but who himself being less gifted had never written any really outstanding book so that if one had been in quest of originality in speech bergotte must have been labelled a disciple a writer at secondhand whereas influenced by his friend only so far as talk went he had been original and creative in his writings doubtless again so as to distinguish himself from the previous generation too fond as it had been of abstractions of weighty commonplaces when bergotte wished to speak favourably of a book what he would bring into prominence what he would quote with approval would always be some scene that furnished the reader with an image some picture that had no rational significance ah yes he would exclaim it is quite admirable there is a little girl in an orange shawl it is excellent or again oh yes there is a passage in which there is a regiment marching along the street yes it is excellent as for style he was not altogether of his time though he remained quite exclusively of his race abominating tolstoy george eliot ibsen and dostoievsky for the word that always came to his lips when he wished to praise the style of any writer was mild yes you know i like chateaubriand better in atalathan in rené he seems to me to be milder he said the word like a doctor who when his patient assures him that milk will give him indigestion answers but you know it is very mild and it is true that there was in bergottes style a kind of harmony similar to that for which the ancients used to praise certain of their orators in terms which we now find it hard to understand accustomed as we are to our own modern tongues in which effects of that kind are not sought he would say also with a shy smile of pages of his own for which some one had expressed admiration i think it is more or less true more or less accurate it may be of some value perhaps but he would say this simply from modesty as a woman to whom one has said that her dress or her daughter is charming replies it is comfortable or she is a good girl but the constructive instinct was too deeply implanted in bergotte for him not to be aware that the sole proof that he had built usefully and on the lines of truth lay in the pleasure that his work had given to himself first of all and afterwards to his readers only many years later when he no longer had any talent whenever he wrote anything with which he was not satisfied so as not to have to suppress it as he ought to have done so as to be able to publish it with a clear conscience he would repeat but to himself this time after all it is more or less accurate it must be of some value to the country so that the phrase murmured long ago among his admirers by the insincere voice of modesty came in the end to be whispered in the secrecy of his heart by the uneasy tongue of pride and the same words which had served bergotte as an unwanted excuse for the excellence of his earliest works became as it were an ineffective consolation to him for the hopeless mediocrity of the latest a kind of austerity of taste which he had a kind of determination to write nothing of which he could not say that it was mild which had made people for so many years regard him as a sterile and precious artist a chiseller of exquisite trifles was on the contrary the secret of his strength for habit forms the style of the writer just as much as the character of the man and the author who has more than once been patient to attain in the expression of his thoughts to a certain kind of attractiveness in so doing lays down unalterably the boundaries of his talent just as if he yields too often to pleasure to laziness to the fear of being put to trouble he will find himself describing in terms which no amount of revision can modify the forms of his own vices and the limits of his virtue if however despite all the analogies which i was to perceive later on between the writer and the man i had not at first sight in mme swanns drawingroom believed that this could be bergotte the author of so many divine books who stood before me perhaps i was not altogether wrong for he himself did not in the strict sense of the word believe it either he did not believe it because he shewed a great assiduity in the presence of fashionable people and yet he was not a snob of literary men and journalists who were vastly inferior to himself of course he had long since learned from the suffrage of his readers that he had genius compared to which social position and official rank were as nothing he had learned that he had genius but he did not believe it because he continued to simulate deference towards mediocre writers in order to succeed shortly in becoming an academician whereas the academy and the faubourg saintgermain have no more to do with that part of the eternal mind which is the author of the works of bergotte than with the law of causality or the idea of god that also he knew but as a kleptomaniac knows without profiting by the knowledge that it is wrong to steal and the man with the little beard and snailshe will nose knew and used all the tricks of the gentleman who pockets your spoons in his efforts to reach the coveted academic chair or some duchess or other who could dispose of several votes at the election but while on his way to them he would endeavour to make sure that no one who would consider the pursuit of such an object a vice in him should see what he was doing he was only halfsuccessful one could hear alternating with the speech of the true bergotte that of the other bergotte ambitious utterly selfish who thought it not worth his while to speak of any but his powerful rich or noble friends so as to enhance his own position he who in his books when he was really himself had so well portrayed the charm pure as a mountain spring of poverty as for those other vices to which m de norpois had alluded that almost incestuous love which was made still worse people said by a want of delicacy in the matter of money if they contradicted in a shocking manner the tendency of his latest novels in which he shewed everywhere a regard for what was right and proper so painfully rigid that the most innocent pleasures of their heroes were poisoned by it and that even the reader found himself turning their pages with a sense of acute discomfort and asked himself whether it was possible to go on living even the quietest of lives those vices did not at all prove supposing that they were fairly imputed to bergotte that his literature was a lie and all his sensitiveness mere playacting just as in pathology certain conditions similar in appearance are due some to an excess others to an insufficiency of tension of secretion and so forth so there may be vice arising from supersensitiveness just as much as from the lack of it perhaps it is only in really vicious lives that the moral problem can arise in all its disquieting strength and of this problem the artist finds a solution in the terms not of his own personal life but of what is for him the true life a general a literary solution as the great doctors of the church began often without losing their virtue by acquainting themselves with the sins of all mankind out of which they extracted their own personal sanctity so great artists often while being thoroughly wicked make use of their vices in order to arrive at a conception of the moral law that is binding upon us all it is the vices or merely the weaknesses and follies of the circle in which they live the meaningless conversation the frivolous or shocking lives of their daughters the infidelity of their wives or their own misdeeds that writers have most often castigated in their books without however thinking it necessary to alter their domestic economy or to improve the tone of their households and this contrast had never before been so striking as it was in bergottes time because on the one hand in proportion as society grew more corrupt our notions of morality were increasingly exalted while on the other hand the public were now told far more than they had ever hitherto known about the private lives of literary men and on certain evenings in the theatre people would point out the author whom i had so greatly admired at combray sitting at the back of a box the mere composition of which seemed an oddly humorous or perhaps keenly ironical commentary upon a brazenfaced denial of the thesis which he had just been maintaining in his latest book not that anything which this or that casual informant could tell me was of much use in helping me to settle the question of the goodness or wickedness of bergotte an intimate friend would furnish proofs of his hardheartedness then a stranger would cite some instance touching since he had evidently wished it to remain hidden of his real depth of feeling he had behaved cruelly to his wife but in a village inn where he had gone to spend the night he had stayed on to watch over a poor woman who had tried to drown herself and when he was obliged to continue his journey had left a large sum of money with the landlord so that he should not turn the poor creature out but see that she got proper attention perhaps the more the great writer was developed in bergotte at the expense of the little man with the beard so much the more his own personal life was drowned in the flood of all the lives that he imagined until he no longer felt himself obliged to perform certain practical duties for which he had substituted the duty of imagining those other lives but at the same time because he imagined the feelings of others as completely as if they had been his own whenever he was obliged for any reason to talk to some person who had been unfortunate that is to say in a casual encounter he would in doing so take up not his own personal standpoint but that of the sufferer himself a standpoint in which he would have been horrified by the speech of those who continued to think of their own petty concerns in the presence of anothers grief with the result that he gave rise everywhere to justifiable rancour and to undying gratitude above all he was a man who in his heart of hearts loved nothing really except certain images and like a miniature set in the floor of a casket the composing and painting of them in words for a trifle that some one had sent him if that trifle gave him the opportunity of introducing one or two of these images he would be prodigal in the expression of his gratitude while shewing none whatever for an expensive present and if he had had to plead before a tribunal he would inevitably have chosen his words not for the effect that they might have on the judge but with an eye to certain images which the judge would certainly never have perceived that first day on which i met him with gilbertes parents i mentioned to bergotte that i had recently been to hear berma in phedre and he told me that in the scene in which she stood with her arm raised to the level of her shoulder one of those very scenes that had been greeted with such applause she had managed to suggest with great nobility of art certain classical figures which quite possibly she had never even seen a hesperid carved in the same attitude upon a metope at olympia and also the beautiful primitive virgins on the erechtheum it may be sheer divination and yet i fancy that she visits the museums it would be interesting to establish that establish was one of those regular bergotte expressions and one which various young men who had never met him had caught from him speaking like him by some sort of telepathic suggestion do you mean the cariatides asked swann no no said bergotte except in the scene where she confesses her passion to oenone where she moves her hand exactly like hegeso on the stele in the ceramic it is a far more primitive art that she revives i was referring to the korai of the old erechtheum and i admit that there is perhaps nothing quite so remote from the art of racine but there are so many things already in phedre that one more oh and then yes she is really charming that little sixth century phaedra the rigidity of the arm the lock of hair frozen into marble yes you know it is wonderful of her to have discovered all that there is a great deal more antiquity in it than in most of the books they are labelling antique this year as bergotte had in one of his volumes addressed a famous invocation to these archaic statues the words that he was now uttering were quite intelligible to me and gave me a fresh reason for taking an interest in bermas acting i tried to picture her again in my mind as she had looked in that scene in which i remembered that she had raised her arm to the level of her shoulder and i said to myself there we have the hesperid of olympia there we have the sister of those adorable suppliants on the acropolis there is indeed nobility in art but if these considerations were to enhance for me the beauty of bermas gesture bergotte should have put them into my head before the performance then while that attitude of the actress was actually existing in flesh and blood before my eyes at that moment in which the thing that was happening had still the substance of reality i might have tried to extract from it the idea of archaic sculpture but of berma in that scene all that i retained was a memory which was no longer liable to modification slender as a picture which lacks that abundant perspective of the present tense where one is free to delve and can always discover something new a picture to which one cannot retrospectively give a meaning that is not subject to verification and correction from without at this point mme swann joined in the conversation asking me whether gilberte had remembered to give me what bergotte had written aboutphedre and adding my daughter is such a scatterbrain bergotte smiled modestly and protested that they were only a few pages of no importance but it is perfectly charming that little pamphlet that little tract of yours mme swann assured him to shew that she was a good hostess to make the rest of us think that she had read bergottes essay and also because she liked not merely to flatter bergotte but to make a selection for herself out of what he wrote to control his writing and it must be admitted that she did inspire him though not in the way that she supposed but when all is said there is between what constituted the smartness of mme swanns drawingroom and a whole side of bergottes work so close a correspondence that either of them might serve among elderly men today as a commentary upon the other i let myself go in telling him what my impressions had been often bergotte disagreed but he allowed me to go on talking i told him that i had liked the green light which was turned on when phaedra raised her arm ah the designer will be glad to hear that he is a real artist i shall tell him you liked it because he is very proud of that effect i must say myself that i do not care for it very much it drowns everything in a sort of aqueous vapour little phaedra standing there looks too like a branch of coral on the floor of an aquarium you will tell me of course that it brings out the cosmic aspect of the play that is quite true all the same it would be more appropriate if the scene were laid in the court of neptune oh yes of course i know the vengeance of neptune does come into the play i do not suggest for a moment that we should think only of portroyal but after all the story that racine tells us is not the loves of the seaurchins still it is what my friend wished to have and it is very well done right or wrong and it is really quite pretty when you come to look at it yes so you liked that did you you understood what it meant of course we feel the same about it do not we really it is a trifle unbalanced what he is done you agree with me but on the whole it is very clever of him and so when bergotte had to express an opinion which was the opposite of my own he in no way reduced me to silence to the impossibility of framing any reply as m de norpois would have done this does not prove that bergottes opinions were of less value than the ambassadors far from it a powerful idea communicates some of its strength to him who challenges it being itself a part of the riches of the universal mind it makes its way into grafts itself upon the mind of him whom it is employed to refute slips in among the ideas already there with the help of which gaining a little ground he completes and corrects it so that the final utterance is always to some extent the work of both parties to a discussion it is to ideas which are not properly speaking ideas at all to ideas which founded upon nothing can find no support no kindred spirit among the ideas of the adversary that he grappling with something which is not there can find no word to say in answer the arguments of m de norpois in the matter of art were unanswerable simply because they were without reality since bergotte did not sweep aside my objections i confessed to him that they had won the scorn of m de norpois but he is an old parrot was the answer he keeps on pecking you because he imagines all the time that you are a piece of cake or a slice of cuttlefish what is that asked swann are you a friend of norpois he is as dull as a wet sunday interrupted his wife who had great faith in bergottes judgment and was no doubt afraid that m de norpois might have spoken ill of her to us i tried to make him talk after dinner i do not know if it is his age or his indigestion but i found him too sticky for words i really thought i should have to dope him yes is not he bergotte chimed in you see he has to keep his mouth shut half the time so as not to use up all the stock of inanities that hold his shirtfront down and his white waistcoat up i think that bergotte and my wife are both very hard on him came from swann who took the line in his own house of a plain sensible man i quite see that norpois cannot interest you very much but from another point of view for swann made a hobby of collecting scraps of real life he is quite remarkable quite a remarkable instance of a lover when he was secretary at rome he went on after making sure that gilberte could not hear him he had here in paris a mistress with whom he was madly in love and he found time to make the double journey every week so as to see her for a couple of hours she was as it happens a most intelligent woman and is quite attractive to this day she is a dowager now and he has had any number of others since then i am sure i should have gone stark mad if the woman i was in love with lived in paris and i was kept shut up in rome nervous men ought always to love as the lower orders say beneath them so that their women have a material inducement to do what they tell them as he spoke swann realised that i might be applying this maxim to himself and odette and as even among superior beings at the moment when you and they seem to be soaring together above the plane of life their personal pride is still basely human he was seized by a violent illwill towards me but this was made manifest only in the uneasiness of his glance he said nothing more to me at the time not that this need surprise us when racine according to a story the truth of which has been exploded though the theme of it may be found recurring every day in parisian life made an illusion to scarron in front of louis xiv the most powerful monarch on earth said nothing to the poet that evening it was on the following day only that he fell but as a theory requires to be stated as a whole swann after this momentary irritation and after wiping his eyeglass finished saying what was in his mind in these words words which were to assume later on in my memory the importance of a prophetic warning which i had not had the sense to take the danger of that kind of love however is that the womans subjection calms the mans jealousy for a time but also makes it more exacting after a little he will force his mistress to live like one of those prisoners whose cells they keep lighted day and night to prevent their escaping and that generally ends in trouble i reverted to m de norpois you must never trust him he has the most wicked tongue said mme swann in an accent which seemed to me to indicate that m de norpois had been saying things about her especially as swann looked across at his wife with an air of rebuke as though to stop her before she went too far meanwhile gilberte who had been told to go and get ready for our drive stayed to listen to the conversation and hovered between her mother and her father leaning affectionately against his shoulder nothing at first sight could be in greater contrast to mme swann who was dark than this child with her red hair and golden skin but after looking at them both for a moment one saw in gilberte many of the features for instance the nose cut short with a sharp unfaltering decision by the unseen sculptor whose chisel repeats its work upon successive generations the expression the movements of her mother to take an illustration from another form of art she made one think of a portrait that was not a good likeness of mme swann whom the painter to carry out some whim of colouring had posed in a partial disguise dressed to go out to a party in venetian character and as not merely was she wearing a fair wig but every atom of a swarthier complexion had been discharged from her flesh which stripped of its veil of brownness seemed more naked covered simply in rays of light she would by an internal sun this makeup was not just superficial but was incarnate in her gilberte had the appearance of embodying some fabulous animal or of having assumed a mythological disguise this reddish skin was so exactly that of her father that nature seemed to have had when gilberte was being created to solve the problem of how to reconstruct mme swann piecemeal without any material at her disposal save the skin of m swann and nature had utilised this to perfection like a master carver who makes a point of leaving the grain the knots of his wood in evidence on gilbertes face at the corner of a perfect reproduction of odettes nose the skin was raised so as to preserve intact the two beauty spots of m swann it was a new variety ot mme swann that was thus obtained growing there by her side like a white lilactree beside a purple at the same time it did not do to imagine the boundary line between these two likenesses as definitely fixed now and then when gilberte smiled one could distinguish the oval of her fathers cheek upon her mothers face as though some one had mixed them together to see what would result from the blend this oval grew distinct as an embryo grows into a living shape it lengthened obliquely expanded and a moment later had disappeared in gilbertes eyes there was the frank and honest gaze of her father this was how she had looked at me when she gave me the agate marble and said keep it to remind yourself of our friendship but were one to put a question to gilberte to ask her what she had been doing then one saw in those same eyes the embarrassment the uncertainty the prevarication the misery that odette used in the old days to shew when swann asked her where she had been and she gave him one of those lying answers which in those days drove the lover to despair and now made him abruptly change the conversation as an incurious and prudent husband often in the champselysées i was disturbed by seeing this look on gilbertes face but as a rule my fears were unfounded for in her a purely physical survival of her mother this look if nothing else had ceased to have any meaning it was when she had been to her classes when she must go home for some lesson that gilbertes pupils executed that movement which in time past in the eyes of odette had been caused by the fear of disclosing that she had during the day opened the door to one of her lovers or was at that moment in a hurry to be at some trystingplace so one could see the two natures of m and mme swann ebb and flow encroaching alternately one upon the other in the body of this mélusine it is of course common knowledge that a child takes after both itsfather and its mother and yet the distribution of the merits and defects which it inherits is so oddly planned that of two good qualities which seemed inseparable in one of the parents you will find but one in the child and allied to that very fault in the other parent which seemed most irreconcilable with it indeed the incarnation of a good moral quality in an incompatible physical blemish is often one of the laws of filial resemblance of two sisters one will combine with the proud bearing of her father the mean little soul of her mother the other abundantly endowed with the paternal intelligence will present it to the world in the aspect which her mother has made familiar her mothers shapeless nose and scraggy bosom are become the bodily covering of talents which you had learned to distinguish beneath a superb presence with the result that of each of the sisters one can say with equal justification that it is she who takes more after one or other of her parents it is true that gilberte was an only child but there were at the least two gilbertes the two natures her fathers and her mothers did more than just blend themselves in her they disputed the possession of her and yet one cannot exactly say that which would let it be thought that a third gilberte was in the meantime suffering by being the prey of the two others whereas gilberte was alternately one and the other and at any given moment no more than one of the two that is to say incapable when she was not being good of suffering accordingly the better gilberte not being able at the time on account of her momentary absence to detect the others lapse from virtue and so the less good of the two was free to enjoy pleasures of an ignoble kind when the other spoke to you from the heart of her father she held broad views you would have liked to engage with her upon a fine and beneficent enterprise you told her so but just as your arrangements were being completed her mothers heart would already have resumed its control hers was the voice that answered and you were disappointed and vexed almost baffled as in the face of a substitution of one person for another by an unworthy thought an insincere laugh in which gilberte saw no harm for they sprang from what she herself at that moment was indeed the disparity was at times so great between these two gilbertes that you asked yourself though without finding an answer what on earth you could have said or done to her last time to find her now so different when she herself had arranged to meet you somewhere not only did she fail to appear and offer no excuse afterwards but whatever the influence might have been that had made her change her mind she shewed herself in so different a character when you did meet her that you might well have supposed that taken in by a likeness such as forms the plot of themenaechmi you were now talking to some one not the person who had so politely expressed her desire to see you had she not shewn signs of an illhumour which revealed that she felt herself to be in the wrong and wished to avoid the necessity of an explanation now then run along and get ready you are keeping us waiting her mother reminded her i am so happy here with my little papa i want to stay just for a minute replied gilberte burying her head beneath the arm of her father who passed his fingers lovingly through her bright hair swann was one of those men who having lived for a long time amid the illusions of love have seen the prosperity that they themselves brought to numberless women increase the happiness of those women without exciting in them any gratitude any tenderness towards their benefactors but in their child they believe that they can feel an affection which being incarnate in their own name will enable them to remain in the world after their death when there should no longer be any charles swann there would still be a mlle swann or a mme somethingelse néeswann who would continue to love the vanished father indeed to love him too well perhaps swann may have been thinking for he acknowledged gilbertes caress with a good girl in that tone made tender by our apprehension to which when we think of the future we are prompted by the too passionate affection of a creature who is destined to survive us to conceal his emotion he joined in our talk about berma he pointed out to me but in a detached a listless tone as though he wished to remain to some extent unconcerned in what he was saying with what intelligence with what an astonishing fitness the actress said to oenone you knew it he was right that intonation at least had a value that was really intelligible and might therefore have satisfied my desire to find incontestable reasons for admiring berma but it was by the very fact of its clarity that it did not at all content me her intonation was so ingenious so definite in intention and in its meaning that it seemed to exist by itself so that any intelligent actress might have learned to use it it was a fine idea but whoever else should conceive it as fully must possess it equally it remained to bermas credit that she had discovered it but is one entitled to use the word discover when the object in question is something that would not be different if one had been given it something that does not belong essentially to ones own nature seeing that some one else may afterwards reproduce it upon my soul your presence among us does raise the tone of the conversation swann observed to me as though to excuse himself to bergotte for he had formed the habit in the guermantes set of entertaining great artists as if they were just ordinary friends whom one seeks only to make eat the dishes that they like play the games or in the country indulge in whatever form of sport they please it seems to me that we are talking a great deal of art he went on but it is so nice i do love it said mme swann throwing me a look of gratitude as well from good nature as because she had not abandoned her old aspirations towards a more intellectual form of conversation after this it was to others of the party and principally to gilberte that bergotte addressed himself i had told him everything that i felt with a freedom which had astonished me and was due to the fact that having acquired with him years before in the course of all those hours of solitary reading in which he was to me merely the better part of myself the habit of sincerity of frankness of confidence i was less frightened by him than by a person with whom i should have been talking for the first time and yet for the same reason i was greatly disturbed by the thought of the impression that i must have been making on him the contempt that i had supposed he would feel for my ideas dating not from that afternoon but from the already distant time in which i had begun to read his books in our garden at combray and yet i ought perhaps to have reminded myself that since it was in all sincerity abandoning myself to the train of my thoughts that i had felt on the one hand so intensely in sympathy with the work of bergotte and on the other hand in the theatre a disappointment the reason of which i did not know those two instinctive movements which had both carried me away could not be so very different from one another but must be obedient to the same laws and that that mind of bergotte which i had loved in his books could not be anything entirely foreign and hostile to my disappointment and to my inability to express it for my intelligence must be a uniform thing perhaps indeed there exists but a single intelligence in which everyone in the world participates towards which each of us from the position of his own separate body turns his eyes as in a theatre where if everyone has his own separate seat there is on the other hand but a single stage of course the ideas which i was tempted to seek to disentangle were probably not those whose depths bergotte usually sounded in his books but if it were one and the same intelligence which we had he and i at our disposal he must when he heard me express those ideas be reminded of them cherish them smile upon them keeping probably in spite of what i supposed before his minds eye a whole world of intelligence other than that an excerpt of which had passed into his books an excerpt upon which i had based my imagination of his whole mental uni just as priests having the widest experience of the human heart are best able to pardon the sins which they do not themselves commit so genius having the widest experience of the human intelligence can best understand the ideas most directly in opposition to those which form the foundation of its own writings i ought to have told myself all this though for that matter it was none too consoling a thought for the benevolent condescension of great minds has as a corollary the incomprehension and hostility of small and one derives far less happiness from the friendliness of a great writer which one finds expressed failing a more intimate association in his books than suffering from the hostility of a woman whom one did not choose for her intelligence but cannot help loving i ought to have told myself all this but i did not i was convinced that i had appeared a fool to bergotte when gilberte whispered in my ear you cannot think how delighted i am because you have made a conquest of my great friend bergotte he is been telling mamma that he found you extremely intelligent where are we going i asked her oh wherever you like you know it is all the same to me but since the incident that had occurred on the anniversary of her grandfathers death i had begun to ask myself whether gilbertes character was not other than i had supposed whether that indifference to what was to be done that wisdom that calm that gentle and constant submission did not indeed conceal passionate longings which her selfesteem would not allow to be visible and which she disclosed only by her sudden resistance whenever by any chance they were frustrated as bergotte lived in the same neighbourhood as my parents we left the house together in the carriage he spoke to me of my health our friends were telling me that you had been ill i am very sorry and yet after all i am not too sorry because i can see quite well that you are able to enjoy the pleasures of the mind and they are probably what mean most to you as to everyone who has known them alas what he was saying how little i felt did it apply to myself whom all reasoning however exalted it might be left cold who was happy only in moments of pure idleness when i was comfortable and well i felt how purely material was everything that i desired in life and how easily i could dispense with the intellect as i made no distinction among my pleasures between those that came to me from different sources of varying depth and permanence i was thinking when the moment came to answer him that i should have liked an existence in which i was on intimate terms with the duchesse de guermantes and often came across as in the old tollhouse in the champselysées a chilly smell that would remind me of combray but in this ideal existence which i dared not confide to him the pleasures of the mind found no place no sir the pleasures of the mind count for very little with me it is not them that i seek after indeed i do not even know that i have ever tasted them you really think not he replied well it may be no wait a minute now yes after all that must be what you like best i can see it now clearly i am certain of it as certainly he did not succeed in convincing me and yet i was already feeling happier less restricted after what m de norpois had said to me i had regarded my moments of dreaming of enthusiasm of selfconfidence as purely subjective and barren of truth but according to bergotte who appeared to understand my case it seemed that it was quite the contrary that the symptom i ought to disregard was in fact my doubts my disgust with myself moreover what he had said about m de norpois took most of the sting out of a sentence from which i had supposed that no appeal was possible are you being properly looked after bergotte asked me who is treating you i told him that i had seen and should probably go on seeing cottard but that is not at all the sort of man you want he told me i know nothing about him as a doctor but i have met him at mme swanns the mans an imbecile even supposing that that does not prevent his being a good doctor which i hesitate to believe it does prevent his being a good doctor for artists for men of intelligence people like you must have suitable doctors i would almost go so far as to say treatment and medicines specially adapted to themselves cottard will bore you and that alone will prevent his treatment from having any effect besides the proper course of treatment cannot possibly be the same for you as for any tom dick or harry nine tenths of the ills from which intelligent people suffer spring from their intellect they need at least a doctor who understands their disease how do you expect that cottard should be able to treat you he has made allowances for the difficulty of digesting sauces for gastric trouble but he has made no allowance for the effect of reading shakespeare so that his calculations are inaccurate in your case the balance is upset you see always the little bottleimp bobbing up again he will find that you have a dilated stomach he has no need to examine you for it since he has it already in his eye you can see it there reflected in his glasses this manner of speaking tired me greatly i said to myself with the stupidity of common sense there is no more any dilated stomach reflected in professor cottards glasses than there are inanities stored behind the white waistcoat of m de norpois i should recommend you instead went on bergotte to consult dr du boulbon who is quite an intelligent man he is a great admirer of your books i replied i saw that bergotte knew this and i decided that kindred spirits soon come together that one has few really unknown friends what bergotte had said to me with respect to cottard impressed me while running contrary to everything that i myself believed i was in no way disturbed by finding my doctor a bore i expected of him that thanks to an art the laws of which were beyond me he should pronounce on the subject of my health an infallible oracle after consultation of my entrails and i did not at all require that with the aid of an intellect in which i easily outstripped him he should seek to understand my intellect which i pictured to myself merely as a means of no importance in itself of trying to attain to certain external verities i doubted greatly whether intellectual people required a different form of hygiene from imbeciles and i was quite prepared to submit myself to the latter kind i will tell you who does need a good doctor and that is our friend swann said bergotte and on my asking whether he was ill well do not you see he is typical of the man who has married a whore and has to swallow a hundred serpents every day from women who refuse to meet his wife or men who were there before him you can see them in his mouth writhing just look any day you are there at the way he lifts his eyebrows when he comes in to see who is in the room the malice with which bergotte spoke thus to a stranger of the friends in whose house he had so long been received as a welcome guest was as new to me as the almost amorous tone which in that house he had constantly been adopting to speak to them certainly a person like my greataunt for instance would have been incapable of treating any of us with that politeness which i had heard bergotte lavishing upon swann even to the people whom she liked she enjoyed saying disagreeable things but behind their backs she would never have uttered a word to which they might not have listened there was nothing less like the social world than our society at combray the swanns house marked a stage on the way towards it towards its inconstant tide if they had not yet reached the open sea they were certainly in the lagoon this is all between ourselves said bergotte as he left me outside my own door a few years later i should have answered i never repeat things that is the ritual phrase of society from which the slanderer always derives a false reassurance it is what i should have said then and there to bergotte for one does not invent all ones speeches especially when one is acting merely as a card in the social pack but i did not yet know the formula what my greataunt on the other hand would have said on a similar occasion was if you do not wish it to be repeated why do you say it that is the answer of the unsociable of the quarrelsome i was nothing of that sort i bowed my head in silence men of letters who were in my eyes persons of considerable importance had had to plot for years before they succeeded in forming with bergotte relations which continued to the end to be but dimly literary and never emerged beyond the four walls of his study whereas i i had now been installed among the friends of the great writer at the first attempt and without any effort like a man who instead of standing outside in a crowd for hours in order to secure a bad seat in a theatre is shewn in at once to the best having entered by a door that is closed to the public if swann had thus opened such a door to me it was doubtless because just as a king finds himself naturally inviting his childrens friends into the royal box or on board the royal yacht so gilbertes parents received their daughters friends among all the precious things that they had in their house and the even more precious intimacies that were enshrined there but at that time i thought and perhaps was right in thinking that this friendliness on swanns part was aimed indirectly at my parents i seemed to remember having heard once at combray that he had suggested to them that in view of my admiration for bergotte he should take me to dine with him and that my parents had declined saying that i was too young and too easily excited to go out yet my parents no doubt represented to certain other people precisely those who seemed to me the most marvellous something quite different from what they were to me so that just as when the lady in pink had paid my father a tribute of which he had shewn himself so unworthy i should have wished them to understand what an inestimable present i had just received and to testify their gratitude to that generous and courteous swann who had offered it to me or to them rather without seeming any more to be conscious of its value than is in luinis fresco the charming mage with the arched nose and fair hair to whom it appeared swann had at one time been thought to bear a striking resemblance unfortunately this favour that swann had done me which as i entered the house before i had even taken off my greatcoat i reported to my parents in the hope that it would awaken in their hearts an emotion equal to my own and would determine them upon some immense and decisive act of politeness towards the swanns did not appear to be greatly appreciated by them swann introduced you to bergotte an excellent friend for you charming society cried my father ironically it only wanted that alas when i had gone on to say that bergotte was by no means inclined to admire m de norpois i dare say retorted my father that simply proves that he is a foolish and evilminded fellow my poor boy you never had much common sense still i am sorry to see you fall among a set that will finish you off altogether already the mere fact of my frequenting the swanns had been far from delighting my parents this introduction to bergotte seemed to them a fatal but natural consequence of an original mistake namely their own weakness in controlling me which my grandfather would have called a want of circumspection i felt that i had only in order to complete their ill humour to tell them that this per fellow who did not appreciate m de norpois had found me extremely intelligent for i had observed that whenever my father decided that anyone one of my school friends for instance was going astray as i was at that moment if that person had the approval of somebody whom my father did not rate high he would see in this testimony the confirmation of his own stern judgment the evil merely seemed to him more pronounced i could hear him already exclaiming of course it all hangs together an expression that terrified me by the vagueness and vastness of the reforms the introduction of which into my quiet life it seemed to threaten but since were i not to tell them what bergotte had said of me even then nothing could efface the impression my parents had formed that this should be made slightly worse mattered little besides they seemed to me so unfair so completely mistaken that not only had i not any hope i had scarcely any desire to bring them to a more equitable point of view at the same time feeling as the words came from my lips how alarmed they would be by the thought that i had found favour in the sight of a person who dismissed clever men as fools and had earned the contempt of all decent people praise from whom since it seemed to me a thing to be desired would only encourage me in wrongdoing it was in faltering tones and with a slightly shamefaced air that coming to the end of my story i flung them the bouquet of he told the swanns that he had found me extremely intelligent just as a poisoned dog in a field rushes without knowing why straight to the grass which is the precise antidote to the toxin that he has swallowed so i without in the least suspecting it had said the one thing in the world that was capable of overcoming in my parents this prejudice with respect to bergotte a prejudice which all the best reasons that i could have urged all the tributes that i could have paid him must have proved powerless to defeat instantly the situation changed oh he said that he found you intelligent repeated my mother i am glad to hear that because he is a man of talent what he said that did he my father joined in i do not for a moment deny his literary distinction before which the whole world bows only it is a pity that he should lead that scarcely reputable existence to which old norpois made a guarded allusion when he was here he went on not seeing that against the sovran virtue of the magic words which i had just repeated the depravity of bergottes morals was little more able to contend than the falsity of his judgment but my dear mamma interrupted we have no proof that it is true people say all sorts of things besides m de norpois may have the most perfect manners in the world but he is not always very goodnatured especially about people who are not exactly his sort that is quite true i have noticed it myself my father admitted and then too a great deal ought to be forgiven bergotte since he thinks well of my little son mamma went on stroking my hair with her fingers and fastening upon me a long and pensive gaze my mother had not indeed awaited this verdict from bergotte before telling me that i might ask gilberte to tea whenever i had friends coming but i dared not do so for two reasons the first was that at gilbertes there was never anything else to drink but tea whereas at home mamma insisted on there being a pot of chocolate as well i was afraid that gilberte might regard this as common and so conceive a great contempt for us the other reason was a formal difficulty a question of procedure which i could never succeed in settling when i arrived at mme swanns she used to ask me and how is your mother i had made several overtures to mamma to find out whether she would do the same when gilberte came to us a point which seemed to me more serious than at the court of louis xiv the use of monseigneur but mamma would not hear of it for a moment certainly not i do not know mme swann but neither does she know you i never said she did but we are not obliged to behave in exactly the same way about everything i shall find other ways of being civil to gilberte than mme swann has with you but i was unconvinced and preferred not to invite gilberte leaving my parents i went upstairs to change my clothes and on emptying my pockets came suddenly upon the envelope which the swanns butler had handed me before shewing me into the drawingroom i was now alone i opened it inside was a card on which i was told the name of the lady whom i ought to have taken in to luncheon it was about this period that bloch overthrew my conception of the world and opened for me fresh possibilities of happiness which for that matter were to change later on into possibilities of suffering by assuring me that in contradiction of all that i had believed at the time of my walks along the méséglise way women never asked for anything better than to make love he added to this service a second the value of which i was not to appreciate until much later it was he who took me for the first time into a disorderly house he had indeed told me that there were any number of pretty women whom one might enjoy but i could see them only in a vague outline for which those houses were to enable me to substitute actual human features so that if i owed to bloch for his good tidings that beauty and the enjoyment of beauty were not inaccessible things and that we have acted foolishly in renouncing them for all time a debt of gratitude of the same kind that we owe to an optimistic physician or philosopher who has given us reason to hope for length of days in this world and not to be entirely cut off from it when we shall have passed beyond the veil the houses of assignation which i began to frequent some years later by furnishing me with specimens of beauty by allowing me to add to the beauty of women that element which we are powerless to invent which is something more than a mere summary of former beauties that present indeed divine the one present that we cannot bestow upon ourselves before which faint and fail all the logical creations of our intellect and which we can seek from reality alone an individual charm deserved to be ranked by me with those other benefactors more recent in origin but of comparable utility before finding which we used to imagine without any warmth the seductive charms of mantegna of wagner of siena by studying other painters hearing other composers visiting other cities namely illustrated editions of the history of painting symphonic concerts and handbooks to mediaeval towns but the house to which bloch led me and which he himself for that matter had long ceased to visit was of too humble a grade its denizens were too inconspicuous and too little varied to be able to satisfy my old or to stimulate new curiosities the mistress of this house knew none of the women with whom one asked her to negotiate and was always suggesting others whom one did not want she boasted to me of one in particular one of whom with a smile full of promise as though this had been a great rarity and a special treat she would whisper she is a jewess does not that make you want to that by the way was probably why the girls name was rachel and with a silly and affected excitement which she hoped would prove contagious and which ended in a hoarse gurgle almost of sensual satisfaction think of that my boy a jewess would not that be lovely rrrr this rachel of whom i caught a glimpse without her seeing me was dark and not good looking but had an air of intelligence and would pass the tip of her tongue over her lips as she smiled with a look of boundless impertinence at the boys who were introduced to her and whom i could hear making conversation her small and narrow face was framed in short curls of black hair irregular as though they were outlined in penstrokes upon a washdrawing in indian ink every evening i promised the old woman who offered her to me with a special insistence boasting of her superior intelligence and her education that i would not fail to come some day on purpose to make the acquaintance of rachel whom i had nicknamed rachel when from the lord but the first evening i had heard her as she was leaving the house say to the mistress that is settled then i shall be free tomorrow if you have anyone you will not forget to send for me and these words had prevented me from recognising her as a person because they had made me classify her at once in a general category of women whose habit common to all of them was to come there in the evening to see whether there might not be a louis or two to be earned she would simply vary her formula saying indifferently if you want me or if you want anybody the mistress who was not familiar with halévys opera did not know why i always called the girl rachel when from the lord but failure to understand a joke has never yet made anyone find it less amusing and it was always with a wholehearted laugh that she would say to me then there is nothing doing tonight when am i going to fix you up with rachel when from the lord why do you always say that rachel when from the lord oh that is very smart that is i am going to make a match of you two you will not be sorry for it you will see once i was just making up my mind but she was in the press another time in the hands of the hairdresser an elderly gentleman who never did anything for the women except pour oil on their loosened hair and then comb it and i grew tired of waiting even though several of the humbler frequenters of the place working girls they called themselves but they always seemed to be out of work had come to mix drinks for me and to hold long conversations to which despite the gravity of the subjects discussed the partial or total nudity of the speakers gave an attractive simplicity i ceased moreover to go to this house because anxious to present a token of my goodwill to the woman who kept it and was in need of furniture i had given her several pieces notably a big sofa which i had inherited from my aunt léonie i used never to see them for want of space had prevented my parents from taking them in at home and they were stored in a warehouse but as soon as i discovered them again in the house where these women were putting them to their own uses all the virtues that one had imbibed in the air of my aunts room at combray became apparent to me tortured by the cruel contact to which i had abandoned them in their helplessness had i outraged the dead i should not have suffered such remorse i returned no more to visit their new mistress for they seemed to me to be alive and to be appealing to me like those objects apparently inanimate in a persian fairytale in which are embodied human souls that are undergoing martyrdom and plead for deliverance besides as our memory presents things to us as a rule not in their chronological sequence but as it were by a reflexion in which the order of the parts is red i remembered only long afterwards that it was upon that same sofa that many years before i had tasted for the first time the sweets of love with one of my girl cousins with whom i had not known where to go until she somewhat rashly suggested our taking advantage of a moment in which aunt léonie had left her room a whole lot more of my aunt léonies things and notably a magnificent set of old silver plate i sold in spite of my parents warnings so as to have more money to spend and to be able to send more flowers to mme swann who would greet me after receiving an immense basket of orchids with if i were your father i should have you up before the magistrate for this how was i to suppose that one day i might regret more than anything the loss of my silver plate and rank certain other pleasures more highly than that which would have shrunk perhaps into none at all of bestowing favours upon gilbertes parents similarly it was with gilberte in my mind and so as not to be separated from her that i had decided not to enter a career of diplomacy abroad it is always thus impelled by a state of mind which is destined not to last that we make our irrevocable decisions i could scarcely imagine that that strange substance which was housed in gilberte and from her permeated her parents and her home leaving me indifferent to all things else could be liberated from her could migrate into another person the same substance unquestionable and yet one that would have a wholly different effect on me for a single malady goes through various evolutions and a delicious poison can no longer be taken with the same impunity when with the passing of the years the hearts power of resistance has diminished my parents meanwhile would have liked to see the intelligence that bergotte had discerned in me made manifest in some remarkable achievement when i still did not know the swanns i thought that i was prevented from working by the state of agitation into which i was thrown by the impossibility of seeing gilberte when i chose but now that their door stood open to me scarcely had i sat down at my desk than i would rise and run to them and after i had left them and was at home again my isolation was only apparent my mind was powerless to swim against the stream of words on which i had allowed myself mechanically to be borne for hours on end sitting alone i continued to fashion remarks such as might have pleased or amused the swanns and to make this pastime more entertaining i myself took the parts of those absent players i put to myself imagined questions so chosen that my brilliant epigrams served merely as happy answers to them though conducted in silence this exercise was none the less a conversation and not a meditation my solitude a mental society in which it was not i myself but other imaginary speakers who controlled my choice of words and in which i felt as i formulated in place of the thoughts that i believed to be true those that came easily to my mind and involved no introspection from without that kind of pleasure entirely passive which sitting still affords to anyone who is burdened with a sluggish digestion had i been less firmly resolved upon setting myself definitely to work i should perhaps have made an effort to begin at once but since my resolution was explicit since within twentyfour hours in the empty frame of that long morrow in which everything was so well arranged because i myself had not yet entered it my good intentions would be realised without difficulty it was better not to select an evening on which i was illdisposed for a beginning for which the following days were not alas to shew themselves any more propitious but i was reasonable it would have been puerile on the part of one who had waited now for years not to put up with a postponement of two or three days confident that by the day after next i should have written several pages i said not a word more to my parents of my decision i preferred to remain patient for a few hours and then to bring to a convinced and comforted grandmother a sample of work that was already under way unfortunately the morrow was not that vast external day to which i in my fever had looked forward when it drew to a close my laziness and my painful struggle to overcome certain internal obstacles had simply lasted twentyfour hours longer and at the end of several days my plans not having matured i had no longer the same hope that they would be realised at once no longer the courage therefore to subordinate everything else to their realisation i began again to keep late hours having no longer to oblige me to go to bed early on any evening the certain hope of seeing my work begun next morning i needed before i could recover my creative energy several days of relaxation and the only time that my grandmother ventured in a gentle and disillusioned tone to frame the reproach well and that work of yours are not we even to speak of it now i resented her intrusion convinced that in her inability to see that my mind was irrevocably made up she had further and perhaps for a long time postponed the execution of my task by the shock which her denial of justice to me had given my nerves since until i had recovered from that shock i should not feel inclined to begin my work she felt that her scepticism had charged blindly into my intention she apologised kissing me i am sorry i shall not say anything again and so that i should not be discouraged assured me that from the day on which i should be quite well again the work would come of its own accord from my superfluity of strength besides i said to myself in spending all my time with the swanns am i not doing exactly what bergotte does to my parents it seemed almost as though idle as i was i was leading since it was spent in the same drawingroom with a great writer the life most favourable to the growth of talent and yet the assumption that anyone can be dispensed from having to create that talent for himself from within himself and can acquire it from some one else is as impossible as it would be to suppose that a man can keep himself in good health in spite of neglecting all the rules of hygiene and of indulging in the worst excesses merely by dining out often in the company of a physician the person by the way who was most completely taken in by this illusion which misled me as well as my parents was mme swann when i explained to her that i was unable to come that i must stay at home and work she looked as though she were thinking that i made a great fuss about nothing that there was something foolish as well as ostentatious in what i had said but bergotte is coming is not he do you mean that you do not think it good what he writes it will be better still very soon she went on for he is more pointed he concentrates more in newspaper articles than in his books where he is apt to spread out too much i have arranged that in future he is to do the leading articles in the figaro he will be distinctly the right man in the right place there and finally come he will tell you better than anyone what you ought to do and so just as one invites a gentleman ranker to meet his colonel it was in the interests of my career and as though masterpieces of literature arose out of getting to know people that she told me not to fail to come to dinner with her next day to meet bergotte and so there was not from the swanns any more than from my parents that is to say from those who at different times had seemed bound to place obstacles in my way any further opposition to that pleasant existence in which i might see gilberte as often as i chose with enjoyment if not with peace of mind there can be no peace of mind in love since the advantage one has secured is never anything but a fresh startingpoint for further desires so long as i had not been free to go to her having my eyes fixed upon that inaccessible goal of happiness i could not so much as imagine the fresh grounds for anxiety that lay in wait for me there once the resistance of her parents was broken and the problem solved at last it began to set itself anew and always in different terms each evening on arriving home i reminded myself that i had things to say to gilberte of prime importance things upon which our whole friendship hung and these things were never the same but at least i was happy and no further menace arose to threaten my happiness one was to appear alas from a quarter in which i had never detected any peril namely from gilberte and myself and yet i ought to have been tormented by what on the contrary reassured me by what i mistook for happiness we are when we love in an abnormal state capable of giving at once to an accident the most simple to all appearance and one that may at any moment occur a seriousaspect which that accident by itself would not bear what makes us so happy is the presence in our heart of an unstable element which we are perpetually arranging to keep in position and of which we cease almost to be aware so long as it is not displaced actually there is in love a permanent strain of suffering which happiness neutralises makes conditional only procrastinates but which may at any moment become what it would long since have been had we not obtained what we were seeking sheer agony on several occasions i felt that gilberte was anxious to put off my visits it is true that when i was at all anxious to see her i had only to get myself invited by her parents who were increasingly persuaded of my excellent influence over her thanks to them i used to think my love is running no risk the moment i have them on my side i can set my mind at rest they have full authority over gilberte until alas i detected certain signs of impatience which she allowed to escape her when her father made me come to the house almost against her will and asked myself whether what i had regarded as a protection for my happiness was not in fact the secret reason why that happiness could not endure the last time that i called to see gilberte it was raining she had been asked to a dancing lesson in the house of some people whom she knew too slightly to be able to take me there with her in view of the dampness of the air i had taken rather more caffeine than usual perhaps on account of the weather or because she had some objection to the house in which this party was being given mme swann as her daughter was leaving the room called her back in the sharpest of tones gilberte and pointed to me to indicate that i had come there to see her and that she ought to stay with me this gilberte had been uttered or shouted rather with the best of intentions towards myself but from the way in which gilberte shrugged her shoulders as she took off her outdoor clothes i divined that her mother had unwittingly hastened the gradual evolution which until then it had perhaps been possible to arrest which was gradually drawing away from me my friend you do not need to go out dancing every day odette told her daughter with a sagacity acquired no doubt in earlier days from swann then becoming once more odette she began speaking to her daughter in english at once it was as though a wall had sprung up to hide from me a part of the life of gilberte as though an evil genius had spirited my friend far away in a language that we know we have substituted for the opacity of sounds the perspicuity of ideas but a language which we do not know is a fortress sealed within whose walls she whom we love is free to play us false while we standing without desperately alert in our impotence can see can prevent nothing so this conversation in english at which a month earlier i should merely have smiled interspersed with a few proper names in french which did not fail to accentuate to give a point to my uneasiness had when conducted within a few feet of me by two motionless persons the same degree of cruelty left me as much abandoned and alone as the forcible abduction of my companion at length mme swann left us that day perhaps from resentment against myself the unwilling because of her not going out to enjoy herself perhaps also because guessing her to be angry with me i was precautionally colder than usual with her the face of gilberte divested of every sign of joy bleak bare pillaged seemed all afternoon to be devoting a melancholy regret to the pasdequatre in which my arrival had prevented her from going to take part and to be defying every living creature beginning with myself to understand the subtle reasons that had determined in her a sentimental attachment to the boston she confined herself to exchanging with me now and again on the weather the increasing violence of the rain the fastness of the clock a conversation punctuated with silences and monosyllables in which i lashed myself on with a sort of desperate rage to the destruction of those moments which we might have devoted to friendship and happiness and on each of our remarks was stamped as it were a supreme harshness by the paroxysm of their stupefying unimportance which at the same time consoled me for it prevented gilberte from being taken in by the banality of my observations and the indifference of my tone in vain was my polite i thought the other day that the clock was slow if anything she evidently understood me to mean how tiresome you are being obstinately as i might protract over the whole length of that rainsodden afternoon the dull cloud of words through which no fitful ray shone i knew that my coldness was not so unalterably fixed as i pretended and that gilberte must be fully aware that if after already saying it to her three times i had hazarded a fourth repetition of the statement that the evenings were drawing in i should have had difficulty in restraining myself from bursting into tears when she was like that when no smile filled her eyes or unveiled her face i cannot describe the devastating monotony that stamped her melancholy eyes and sullen features her face grown almost livid reminded me then of those dreary beaches where the sea ebbing far out wearies one with its faint shimmering everywhere the same fixed in an immutable and low horizon at length as i saw no sign in gilberte of the happy change for which i had been waiting now for some hours i told her that she was not being nice it is you that are not being nice was her answer oh but surely i asked myself what i could have done and finding no answer put the question to her naturally you think yourself nice she said to me with a laugh and went on laughing whereupon i felt all the anguish that there was for me in not being able to attain to that other less perceptible plane of her mind which her laughter indicated it seemed that laughter to mean no no i am not going to let myself be moved by anything that you say i know you are madly in love with me but that leaves me neither hot nor cold for i do not care a rap for you but i told myself that after all laughter was not a language so well defined that i could be certain of understanding what this laugh really meant and gilbertes words were affectionate but how am i not being nice i asked her tell me i will do anything you want no that would not be any good i cannot explain for a moment i was afraid that she thought that i did not love her and this was for me a fresh agony no less keen but one that required treatment by a different conversational method if you knew how much you were hurting me you would tell me but this pain which had she doubted my love for her must have rejoiced her seemed instead to make her more angry then realising my mistake making up my mind to pay no more attention to what she said letting her without bothering to believe her assure me i do love you indeed i do you will see one day that day on which the guilty are convinced that their innocence will be made clear and which for some mysterious reason never happens to be the day on which their evidence is taken i had the courage to make a sudden resolution not to see her again and without telling her of it yet since she would not have believed me grief that is caused one by a person with whom one is in love can be bitter even when it is interpolated among preoccupations occupations pleasures in which that person is not directly involved and from which our attention is diverted only now and again to return to it but when such a grief has its birth as was now happening at a moment when the happiness of seeing that person fills us to the exclusion of all else the sharp depression that then affects our spirits sunny hitherto sustained and calm let us loose in us a raging tempest against which we know not whether we are capable of struggling to the end the tempest that was blowing in my heart was so violent that i made my way home baffled battered feeling that i could recover my breath only by retracing my steps by returning upon whatever pretext into gilbertes presence but she would have said to herself back again evidently i can go to any length with him he will come back every time and the more wretched he is when he leaves me the more docile he will be besides i was irresistibly drawn towards her in thought and those alternative orientations that mad careering between them of the compassneedle within me persisted after i had reached home and expressed themselves in the mutually contradictory letters to gilberte which i began to draft i was about to pass through one of those difficult crises which we generally find that we have to face at various stages in life and which for all that there has been no change in our character in our nature that nature which itself creates our loves and almost creates the women whom we love even to their faults we do not face in the same way on each occasion that is to say at every age at such moments our life is divided and so to speak distributed over a pair of scales in two counterpoised pans which between them contain it all in one there is our desire not to displease not to appear too humble to the creature whom we love without managing to understand her but whom we find it more convenient at times to appear almost to disregard so that she shall not have that sense of her own indispensability which may turn her from us in the other scale there is a feeling of pain and one that is not localised and partial only which cannot be set at rest unless abandoning every thought of pleasing the woman and of making her believe that we can dispense with her we go at once to find her when we withdraw from the pan in which our pride lies a small quantity of the willpower which we have weakly allowed to exhaust itself with increasing age when we add to the pan that holds our suffering a physical pain which we have acquired and have let grow then instead of the courageous solution that would have carried the day at oneandtwenty it is the other grown too heavy and insufficiently balanced that crushes us down at fifty all the more because situations while repeating themselves tend to alter and there is every likelihood that in middle life or in old age we shall have had the grim satisfaction of complicating our love by an intrusion of habit which adolescence repressed by other demands upon it less master of itself has never known i had just written gilberte a letter in which i allowed the tempest of my wrath to thunder not however without throwing her the lifebuoy of a few words disposed as though by accident on the page by clinging to which my friend might be brought to a reconciliation a moment later the wind having changed they were phrases full of love that i addressed to her chosen for the sweetness of certain forlorn expressions those nevermores so touching to those who pen them so wearisome to her who will have to read them whether she believe them to be false and translate nevermore by this very evening if you want me or believe them to be true and so to be breaking the news to her of one of those final separations which make so little difference to our lives when the other person is one with whom we are not in love but since we are incapable while we are in love of acting as fit predecessors of the next persons whom we shall presently have become and who will then be in love no longer how are we to imagine the actual state of mind of a woman whom even when we are conscious that we are of no account to her we have perpetually represented in our musings as uttering so as to lull us into a happy dream or to console us for a great sorrow the same speeches that she would make if she loved us when we come to examine the thoughts the actions of a woman whom we love we are as completely at a loss as must have been face to face with the phenomena of nature the worlds first natural philosophers before their science had been elaborated and had cast a ray of light over the unknown or worse still we are like a person in whose mind the law of causality barely exists a person who would be incapable therefore of establishing any connexion between one phenomenon and another to whose eyes the spectacle of the world would appear unstable as a dream of course i made efforts to emerge from this incoherence to find reasons for things i tried even to be objective and to that end to bear well in mind the disproportion that existed between the importance which gilberte had in my eyes and that not only which i had in hers but which she herself had in the eyes of other people a disproportion which had i failed to remark it would have involved my mistaking mere friendliness on my friends part for a passionate avowal and a grotesque and debasing display on my own for the simple and graceful movement with which we are attracted towards a pretty face but i was afraid also of falling into the contrary error in which i should have seen in gilbertes unpunctuality in keeping an appointment an irremediable hostility i tried to discover between these two perspectives equally distorting a third which would enable me to see things as they really were the calculations i was obliged to make with that object helped to take my mind off my sufferings and whether in obedience to the laws of arithmetic or because i had made them give me the answer that i desired i made up my mind that next day i would go to the swanns happy but happy in the same way as people who having long been tormented by the thought of a journey which they have not wished to make go no farther than to the station and return home to unpack their boxes and since while one is hesitating the bare idea of a possible resolution unless one has rendered that idea sterile by deciding that one will make no resolution develops like a seed in the ground the lineaments every detail of the emotions that will be born from the performance of the action i told myself that it had been quite absurd of me to be as much hurt by the suggestion that i should not see gilberte again as if i had really been about to put that suggestion into practice and that since on the contrary i was to end by returning to her side i might have saved myself the expense of all those vain longings and painful acceptances but this resumption of friendly relations lasted only so long as it took me to reach the swanns not because their butler who was really fond of me told me that gilberte had gone out a statement the truth of which was confirmed as it happened the same evening by people who had seen her somewhere but because of the manner in which he said it sir the young lady is not at home i can assure you sir that i am speaking the truth if you wish to make any inquiries i can fetch the young ladys maid you know very well sir that i would do everything in my power to oblige you and that if the young lady was at home i would take you to her at once these words being of the only kind that is really important that is to say spontaneous the kind that gives us a radiograph shewing the main points at any rate of the unimaginable reality which would be wholly concealed beneath a prepared speech proved that in gilbertes household there was an impression that i bothered her with my visits and so scarcely had the man uttered them before they had aroused in me a hatred of which i preferred to make him rather than gilberte the victim he drew upon his own head all the angry feelings that i might have had for my friend freed from these complications thanks to his words my love subsisted alone but his words had at the same time shewn me that i must cease for the present to attempt to see gilberte she would be certain to write to me to apologise in spite of which i should not return at once to see her so as to prove to her that i was capable of living without her besides once i had received her letter gilbertes society was a thing with which i should be more easily able to dispense for a time since i should be certain of finding her ready to receive me whenever i chose all that i needed in order to support with less pain the burden of a voluntary separation was to feel that my heart was rid of the terrible uncertainty whether we were not irreconcilably sundered whether she had not promised herself to another left paris been taken away by force the days that followed resembled the first week of that old new year which i had had to spend alone without gilberte but when that week had dragged to its end then for one thing my friend would be coming again to the champselysées i should be seeing her as before i had been sure of that for another thing i had known with no less certainty that so long as the new year holidays lasted it would not be worth my while to go to the champselysées which meant that during that miserable week which was already ancient history i had endured my wretchedness with a quiet mind because there was blended in it neither fear nor hope now on the other hand it was the latter of these which almost as much as my fear of what might happen rendered intolerable the burden of my grief not having had any letter from gilberte that evening i had attributed this to her carelessness to her other occupations i did not doubt that i should find something from her in the mornings post this i awaited every day with a beating heart which subsided leaving me utterly prostrate when i had found in it only letters from people who were not gilberte or else nothing at all which was no worse the proofs of anothers friendship making all the more cruel those of her indifference i transferred my hopes to the afternoon post even between the times at which letters were delivered i dared not leave the house for she might be sending hers by a messenger then the time coming at last when neither the postman nor a footman from the swanns could possibly appear that night i must procrastinate my hope of being set at rest and thus because i believed that my sufferings were not destined to last i was obliged so to speak incessantly to renew them my disappointment was perhaps the same but instead of just uniformly prolonging as in the old days an initial emotion it began again several times daily starting each time with an emotion so frequently renewed that it ended it so purely physical so instantaneous a state by becoming stabilised so consistently that the strain of waiting having hardly time to relax before a fresh reason for waiting supervened there was no longer a single minute in the day in which i was not in that state of anxiety which it is so difficult to bear even for an hour so my punishment was infinitely more cruel than in those new year holidays long ago because this time there was in me instead of the acceptance pure and simple of that punishment the hope at every moment of seeing it come to an end and yet at this state of acceptance i ultimately arrived then i understood that it must be final and i renounced gilberte for ever in the interests of my love itself and because i hoped above all that she would not retain any contemptuous memory of me indeed from that moment so that she should not be led to suppose any sort of lovers spite on my part when she made appointments for me to see her i used often to accept them and then at the last moment write to her that i was prevented from coming but with the same protestations of my disappointment that i should have made to anyone whom i had not wished to see these expressions of regret which we keep as a rule for people who do not matter would do more i imagined to persuade gilberte of my indifference than would the tone of indifference which we affect only to those whom we love when better than by mere words by a course of action indefinitely repeated i should have proved to her that i had no appetite for seeing her perhaps she would discover once again an appetite for seeing me alas i was doomed to failure to attempt by ceasing to see her to reawaken in her that inclination to see me was to lose her for ever first of all because when it began to revive if i wished it to last i must not give way to it at once besides the most agonising hours would then have passed it was at this very moment that she was indispensable to me and i should have liked to be able to warn her that what presently she would have to assuage by the act of seeing me again would be a grief so far diminished as to be no longer what a moment ago it would still have been nor the thought of putting an end to it a motive towards surrender reconciliation further meetings and then again later on when i should at last be able safely to confess to gilberte so far would her liking for me have regained its strength my liking for her the latter not having been able to resist the strain of so long a separation would have ceased to exist gilberte would have become immaterial to me i knew this but i could not explain it to her she would have assumed that if i was pretending that i should cease to love her if i remained for too long without seeing her that was solely in order that she might summon me back to her at once in the meantime what made it easier for me to sentence myself to this separation was the fact that in order to make it quite clear to her that despite my protestations to the contrary it was my own free will and not any conflicting engagement not the state of my health that prevented me from seeing her whenever i knew beforehand that gilberte would not be in the house was going out somewhere with a friend and would not be home for dinner i went to see mme swann who had once more become to me what she had been at the time when i had such difficulty in seeing her daughter and on days when the latter was not coming to the champselysées used to repair to the allée des acacias in this way i should be hearing about gilberte and could be certain that she would in due course hear about me and in terms which would shew her that i was not interested in her and i found as all those who suffer find that my melancholy condition might have been worse for being free at any time to enter the habitation in which gilberte dwelt i constantly reminded myself for all that i was firmly resolved to make no use of that privilege that if ever my pain grew too sharp there was a way of making it cease i was not unhappy save only from day to day and even that is an exaggeration how many times in an hour but now without that anxious expectancy which had strained every nerve of me in the first weeks after our quarrel before i had gone again to the swanns did i not repeat to myself the words of the letter which one day soon gilberte would surely send would perhaps even bring to me herself the perpetual vision of that imagined happiness helped me to endure the desolation of my real happiness with women who do not love us as with the missing the knowledge that there is no hope left does not prevent our continuing to wait for news we live on tenterhooks starting at the slightest sound the mother whose son has gone to sea on some perilous voyage of discovery sees him in imagination every moment long after the fact of his having perished has been established striding into the room saved by a miracle and in the best of health and this strain of waiting according to the strength of her memory and the resistance of her bodily organs either helps her on her journey through the years at the end of which she will be able to endure the knowledge that her son is no more to forget gradually and to survive his loss or else it kills her on the other hand my grief found consolation in the idea that my love must profit by it each visit that i paid to mme swann without seeing gilberte was a cruel punishment but i felt that it correspondingly enhanced the idea that gilberte had of me besides if i always took care before going to see mme swann that there should be no risk of her daughters appearing that arose it is true from my determination to break with her but no less perhaps from that hope of reconciliation which overlay my intention to renounce her very few of such intentions are absolute at least in a continuous form in this human soul of ours one of whose laws confirmed by the unlookedfor wealth of illustration that memory supplies is intermittence and hid from me all that in it was unbearably cruel as for that hope i saw clearly how far it was chimerical i was like a pauper who moistens his dry crust with fewer tears if he assures himself that at any moment a total stranger is perhaps going to leave him the whole of his fortune we are all of us obliged if we are to make reality endurable to nurse a few little follies in ourselves now my hope remained more intact while at the same time our separation became more effectual if i refrained from meeting gilberte if i had found myself face to face with her in her mothers drawingroom we might perhaps have uttered irrevocable words which would have rendered our breach final killed my hope and on the other hand by creating a fresh anxiety reawakened my love and made resignation harder ever so long ago before i had even thought of breaking with her daughter mme swann had said to me it is all very well your coming to see gilberte i should like you to come sometimes for my sake not to my kettledrums which would bore you because there is such a crowd but on the other days when you will always find me at home if you come fairly late so that i might be thought when i came to see her to be yielding only after a long resistance to a desire which she had expressed in the past and very late in the afternoon when it was quite dark almost at the hour at which my parents would be sitting down to dinner i would set out to pay mme swann a visit in the course of which i knew that i should not see gilberte and yet should be thinking only of her in that quarter then looked upon as remote of a paris darker than paris is today where even in the centre there was no electric light in the public thoroughfares and very little in private houses the lamps of a drawingroom situated on the ground level or but slightly raised above it as were the rooms in which mme swann generally received her visitors were enough to lighten the street and to make the passerby raise his eyes connecting with their glow as with its apparent though hidden because the presence outside the door of a string of smart broughams this passerby was led to believe not without a certain emotion that a modification had been effected in this mysterious because when he saw one of the carriages begin to move but it was merely a coachman who afraid of his horses catching cold started them now and again on a brisk walk all the more impressive because the rubbertired wheels gave the sound of their hooves a background of silence from which it stood out more distinct and more explicit the wintergarden of which in those days the passerby generally caught a glimpse in whatever street he might be walking if the drawingroom did not stand too high above the pavement is to be seen today only in photogravures in the giftbooks of p j stahl where in contrast to the infrequent floral decorations of the louis xvi drawingrooms now in fashion a single rose or a japanese iris in a longnecked vase of crystal into which it would be impossible to squeeze a second it seems because of the profusion of indoor plants which people had then and of the absolute want of style in their arrangement as though it must have responded in the ladies whose houses it adorned to some living and delicious passion for botany rather than to any cold concern for lifeless decoration it suggested to one only on a larger scale in the houses of those days those tiny portable hothouses laid out on new years morning beneath the lighted lamp for the children were always too impatient to wait for daylight among all the other new years presents but the loveliest of them all consoling them with its real plants which they could tend as they grew for the bareness of the winter soil and even more than those little houses themselves those wintergardens were like the hothouse that the children could see there at the same time portrayed in a delightful book another of their presents and one which for all that it was given not to them but to mlle lili the heroine of the story enchanted them to such a pitch that even now when they are almost old men and women they ask themselves whether in those fortunate years winter was not the loveliest of the seasons and inside there beyond the wintergarden through the various kinds of arborescence which from the street made the lighted window appear like the glass front of one of those childrens playthings pictured or real the passerby drawing himself up on tiptoe would generally observe a man in a frock coat a gardenia or a carnation in his buttonhole standing before a seated lady both vaguely outlined like two intaglios cut in a topaz in the depths of the drawingroom atmosphere clouted by the samovar then a recent importation with steam which may very possibly be escaping from it still today but to which if it does we are grown so accustomed now that no one notices it mme swann attached great importance to her tea she thought that she shewed her originality and expressed her charm when she said to a man you will find me at home any day fairly late come to tea so that she allowed a sweet and delicate smile to accompany the words which she pronounced with a fleeting trace of english accent and which her listener duly noted bowing solemnly in acceptance as though the invitation had been something important and uncommon which commanded deference and required attention there was another reason apart from those given already for the flowers having more than a merely ornamental part in mme swanns drawingroom and this reason pertained not to the period but in some degree to the former life of odette a great courtesan such as she had been lives largely for her lovers that is to say at home which means that she comes in time to live for her home the things that one sees in the house of a respectable woman things which may of course appear to her also to be of importance are those which are in any event of the utmost importance to the courtesan the culminating point of her day is not the moment in which she dresses herself for all the world to see but that in which she undresses herself for a man she must be as smart in her wrapper in her nightgown as in her outdoor attire other women display their jewels but as for her she lives in the intimacy of her pearls this kind of existence imposes on her as an obligation and ends by giving her a fondness for luxury which is secret that is to say which comes near to being disinterested mme swann extended this to include her flowers there was always beside her chair an immense bowl of crystal filled to the brim with parma violets or with long white daisypetals scattered upon the water which seemed to be testifying in the eyes of the arriving guest to some favourite and interrupted occupation such as the cup of tea which mme swann would for her own amusement have been drinking there by herself an occupation more intimate still and more mysterious so much so that one felt oneself impelled to apologise on seeing the flowers exposed there by her side as one would have apologised for looking at the title of the still open book which would have revealed to one what had just been read by and so perhaps what was still in the mind of odette and unlike the book the flowers were living things it was annoying when one entered the room to pay mme swann a visit to discover that she was not alone or if one came home with her not to find the room empty so prominent a place in it enigmatic and intimately associated with hours in the life of their mistress of which one knew nothing did those flowers assume which had not been made ready for odettes visitors but as it were forgotten there by her had held and would hold with her again private conversations which one was afraid of disturbing the secret of which one tried in vain to read fastening ones eyes on the moist purple the still liquid watercolour of the parma violets by the end of october odette would begin to come home with the utmost punctuality for tea which was still known at that time as fiveof the clock tea having once heard it said and being fond of repeating that if mme verdurin had been able to form a salon it was because people were always certain of finding her at home at the same hour she imagined that she herself had one also of the same kind but freer senza rigore as she used to say she saw herself figuring thus as a sort of lespinasse and believed that she had founded a rival salon by taking from the du defiant of the little group several of her most attractive men notably swann himself who had followed her in her secession and into her retirement accordingto a version for which one can understand that she had succeeded in gaining credit among her more recent friends ignorant of what had passed though without convincing herself but certain favourite parts are played by us so often before the public and rehearsed so carefully when we are alone that we find it easier to refer to their fictitious testimony than to that of a reality which we have almost entirely forgotten on days on which mme swann had not left the house one found her in a wrapper of crepedechine white as the first snows of winter or it might be in one of those long pleated garments of moussettnedesoie which seemed nothing more than a shower of white or rosy petals and would be regarded today as hardly suitable for winter though quite wrongly for these light fabrics and soft colours gave to a woman in the stifling warmth of the drawingrooms of those days with their heavily curtained doors rooms of which the most effective thing that the society novelists of the time could find to say was that they were exquisitely cushioned the same air of coolness that they gave to the roses which were able to stay in the room there by her side despite the winter in the glowing flesh tints of their nudity as though it were already spring by reason of the muffling of all sound in the carpets and of the remoteness of her cosy retreat the lady of the house not being apprised of your entry as she is today would continue to read almost until you were standing before her chair which enhanced still further that sense of the romantic that charm of a sort of secret discovery which we find today in the memory of those gowns already out of fashion even then which mme swann was perhaps alone in not having discarded and which give us the feeling that the woman who wore them must have been the heroine of a novel because most of us have scarcely set eyes on them outside the pages of certain of henry grévilles tales odette had at this time in her drawingroom when winter began chrysanthemums of enormous size and a variety of colours such as swann in the old days certainly never saw in her drawingroom in the rue la pérouse my admiration for them when i went to pay mme swann one of those melancholy visits during which prompted by my sorrow i discovered in her all the mystical poetry of her character as the mother of that gilberte to whom she would say on the morrow your friend came to see me yesterday sprang no doubt from my sense that rosepale like the louis xiv silk that covered her chairs snowwhite like her crepedechine wrapper or of a metallic red like her samovar they superimposed upon the decoration of the room another a supplementary scheme of decoration as rich as delicate in its colouring but one which was alive and would last for a few days only but i was touched to find that these chrysanthemums appeared less ephemeral than one might almost say lasting when i compared them with the tones as pink as coppery which the setting sun so gorgeously displays amid the mists of a november afternoon and which after seeing them before i had entered the house fade from the sky i found again inside prolonged transposed on to the flaming palette of the flowers like the fires caught and fixed by a great colourist from the impermanence of the atmosphere and the sun so that they should enter and adorn a human dwelling they invited me those chrysanthemums to put away all my sorrows and to taste with a greedy rapture during that teatime the too fleeting joys of november of which they set ablaze all around me the intimate and mystical glory alas it was not in the conversations to which i must listen that i could hope to attain to that glory they had but little in common with it even with mme cottard and although it was growing late mme swann would assume her most caressing manner to say oh no it is not late really you must not look at the clock that is not the right time it is stopped you cannot possibly have anything else to do now why be in such a hurry as she pressed a final tartlet upon the professors wife who was gripping her cardcase in readiness for flight one simply cannot tear oneself away from this house observed mme bontemps to mme swann while mme cottard in her astonishment at hearing her own thought put into words exclaimed why that is just what i always say myself what i tell my own little judge in the court of conscience winning the applause of the gentlemen from the jockey club who had been profuse in their salutations as though confounded at such an honours being done them when mme swann had introduced them to this common and by no means attractive little woman who kept herself when confronted with odettes brilliant friends in reserve if not on what she herself called the defensive for she always used stately language to describe the simplest happenings i should never have suspected it was mme swanns comment three wednesdays running you have played me false that is quite true odette it is simply ages it is an eternity since i saw you last you see i plead guilty but i must tell you she went on with a vague suggestion of outraged modesty for although a doctors wife she would never have dared to speak without periphrasis of rheumatism or of a chill on the kidneys that i have had a lot of little troubles as we all have i dare say and besides that i have had a crisis among my masculine domestics i am sure i am no more imbued with a sense of my own authority than most ladies still i have been obliged just to make an example you know to give my vatel notice i believe he was looking out anyhow for a more remunerative place but his departure nearly brought about the resignation of my entire ministry my own maid refused to stay in the house a moment longer oh we have had some homeric scenes however i held fast to the reins through thick and thin the whole affairs been a perfect lesson which will not be lost on me i can tell you i am afraid i am boring you with all these stories about servants but you know as well as i do what a business it is when one is obliged to set about rearranging ones household are not we to see anything of your delicious child she wound up no my delicious child is dining with a friend replied mme swann and then turning to me i believe she is written to you asking you to come and see her tomorrow and your babies she went on to mme cottard i breathed a sigh of relief these words by which mme swann proved to me that i oould see gilberte whenever i chose gave me precisely the comfort which i had come to seek and which at that time made my visits to mme swann so necessary no i am afraid not i shall write to her anyhow this evening gilberte and i never seem to see one another now i added pretending to attribute our separation to some mysterious agency which gave me a further illusion of being in love supported as well by the affectionate way in which i spoke of gilberte and she of me you know she is simply devoted to you said mme swann really you will not come tomorrow suddenly my heart rose on wings the thought had just struck me after all why should not i since it is her own mother who suggests it but with the thought i fell back into my old depression i was afraid now lest when she saw me again gilberte might think that my indifference of late had been feigned and it seemed wiser to prolong our separation during these asides mme bontemps had been complaining of the insufferable dulness of politicians wives for she pretended to find everyone too deadly or too stupid for words and to deplore her husbands official position do you mean to say you can shake hands with fifty doctors wives like that one after the other she exclaimed to mme cottard who unlike her was full of the kindest feelings for everybody and of determination to do her duty in every respect ah you are a lawabiding woman you see in my case at the ministry do not you know i simply have to keep it up of course it is too much for me i can tell you you know what those officials wives are like it is all i can do not to put my tongue out at them and my niece albertine is just like me you really would not believe the impudence that girl has last week on my day i had the wife of the under secretary of state for finance who told us that she knew nothing at all about cooking but surely madam my niece chipped in with her most winning smile you ought to know everything about it after all the dishes your father had to wash oh i do love that story i think it is simply exquisite cried mme swann but certainly on the doctors consultation days you should make a point of being at home among your flowers and books and all your pretty things she urged mme cottard straight out like that bang right in the face bang she made no bones about it i can tell you and she would never said a word to me about it the little wretch she is as cunning as a monkey you are lucky to be able to control yourself i do envy people who can hide what is in their minds but i have no need to do that mme bontemps i am not so hard to please mme cottard gently expostulated for one thing i am not in such a privileged position she went on slightly raising her voice as was her custom as though she were underlining the point of her remark whenever she slipped into the conversation any of those delicate courtesies those skilful flatteries which won her the admiration and assisted the career of her husband and besides i am only too glad to do anything that can be of use to the professor but my dear it is not what ones glad to do it is what one is able to do i expect you are not nervous do you know whenever i see the war ministers wife making faces i start copying her at once it is a dreadful thing to have a temperament like mine to be sure yes said mme cottard i have heard people say that she had a twitch my husband knows someone else who occupies a very high position and it is only natural when gentlemen get talking together and then do not you know it is just the same with the chief of the registry he is a hunchback whenever he comes to see me before he is been in the room five minutes my fingers are itching to stroke his hump my husband says i will cost him his place what if i do a fig for the ministry yes a fig for the ministry i should like to have that printed as a motto on my notepaper i can see i am shocking you you are so frightfully proper but i must say there is nothing amuses me like a little devilry now and then life would be dreadfully monotonous without it and she went on talking about the ministry all the time as though it had been mount olympus to change the conversation mme swann turned to mme cottard but you are looking very smart today redfern fecit no you know i always swear by rauthnitz besides it is only an old thing i have had done up not really it is charming guess how much no change the first figure you do not say so why that is nothing it is given away three times that at least i should have said you see how history comes to be written apostrophised the doctors wife and pointing to a neckribbon which had been a present from mme swann look odette do you recognise this through the gap between a pair of curtains a head peeped with ceremonious deference making a playful pretence of being afraid of disturbing the party it was swann odette the prince dagrigente is with me in the study he wants to know if he may pay his respects to you what am i to tell him why that i shall be delighted odette would reply secretly flattered but without losing anything of the composure which came to her all the more easily since she had always even in her fast days been accustomed to entertain men of fashion swann disappeared to deliver the message and would presently return with the prince unless in the meantime mme verdurin had arrived when he married odette swann had insisted on her ceasing to frequent the little clan he had several good reasons for this stipulation though had he had none he would have made it just the same in obedience to a law of ingratitude which admits no exception and proves that every gobetween is either lacking in foresight or else singularly disinterested he had conceded only that odette and mme verdurin might exchange visits once a year and even this seemed excessive to some of the faithful indignant at the insult offered to the mistress who for so many years had treated odette and even swann himself as the spoiled children of her house for if it contained false brethren who failed upon certain evenings in order that they might secretly accept an invitation from odette ready in the event of discovery with the excuse that they were anxious to meet bergotte although the mistress assured them that he never went to the swanns and even if he did had no vestige of talent really in spite of which she was making the most strenuous efforts to quote one of her favourite expressions to attract him the little group had its diehards also and these though ignorant of those conventional refinements which often dissuade people from the extreme attitude one would have liked to see them adopt in order to annoy some one else would have wished mme verdurin but had never managed to prevail upon her to sever all connection with odette and thus deprive odette of the satisfaction of saying with a mocking laugh we go to the mistresss very seldom now since the schism it was all very well while my husband was still a bachelor but when one is married you know it is not always so easy if you must know m swann cannot abide old ma verdurin and he would not much like the idea of my going there regularly as i used to and i as a dutiful spouse do not you see swann would accompany his wife to their annual evening there but would take care not to be in the room when mme verdurin came to call and so if the mistress was in the drawingroom the prince dagrigente would enter it alone alone too he was presented to her by odette who preferred that mme verdurin should be left in ignorance of the names of her humbler guests and so might seeing more than one strange face in the room be led to believe that she was mixing with the cream of the aristocracy a device which proved so far successful that mme verdurin said to her husband that evening with profound contempt charming people her friends i met all the fine flower of the reaction odette was living with respect to mme verdurin under a con illusion not that the latters salon had ever begun at that time to develop into what we shail one day see it to have become mme verdurin had not yet reached the period of incubation in which one dispenses with ones big parties where the few brilliant specimens recently acquired would be lost in too numerous a crowd and prefers to wait until the generative force of the ten righteous whom one has succeeded in attracting shall have multiplied those ten seventyfold as odette was not to be long now in doing mme verdurin did indeed entertain the idea of society as her final objective but her zone of attack was as yet so restricted and moreover so remote from that in which odette had some chance of arriving at an identical goal of breaking the line of defence that the latter remained absolutely ignorant of the strategic plans which the mistress was elaborating and it was with the most perfect sincerity that odette when anyone spoke to her of mme verdurin as a snob would answer laughing oh no quite the opposite for one thing she never gets a chance of being a snob she does not know anyone and then to do her justice i must say that she seems quite pleased not to know anyone no what she likes are her wednesdays and people who talk well and in her heart of hearts she envied mme verdurin for all that she did not despair of having herself in so eminent a school succeeded in acquiring them those arts to which the mistress attached such paramount importance albeit they did but discriminate between shades of the nonexistent sculpture the void and were properly speaking the arts of nonentity to wit those in the lady of a house of knowing how to bring people together how to group to draw out to keep in the background to act as a connecting link in any case mme swanns friends were impressed when they saw in her house a lady of whom they were accustomed to think only as in her own in an inseparable setting of her guests amid the whole of her little group which they were astonished to behold thus suggested summarised assembled packed into a single armchair in the bodily form of the mistress the hostess turned visitor muffled in her cloak with its grebe trimming as shaggy as the white skins that carpeted that drawingroom embowered in which mme verdurin was a drawingroom in herself the more timid among the women thought it prudent to retire and using the plural as people do when they mean to hint to the rest of the room that it is wiser not to tire a convalescent who is out of bed for the first time odette they murmured we are going to leave you they envied mme cottard whom the mistress called by her christian name can i drop you anywhere mme verdurin asked her unable to bear the thought that one of the faithful was going to remain behind instead of following her from the room oh but this lady has been so very kind as to say she will take me replied mme cottard not wishing to appear to be forgetting when approached by a more illustrious personage that she had accepted the offer which mme bontémps had made of driving her home behind her cockaded coachman i must say that i am always specially grateful to the friends who are so kind as to take me with them in their vehicles it is a regular godsend to me who have no automedon especially broke in the mistress who felt that she must say something since she knew mme bontémps slightly and had just invited her to her wednesdays as at mme de crécys house you are not very near home oh good gracious i shall never get into the way of saying mme swann it was a recognised pleasantry in the little clan among those who were not overendowed with wit to pretend that they could never grow used to saying mme swann i have been so accustomed to saying mme de crécy that i nearly went wrong again only mme verdurin when she spoke to odette was not content with the nearly but went wrong on purpose do not you feel afraid odette living out in the wilds like this i am sure i should not feel at all comfortable coming home after dark besides it is so damp it cannot be at all good for your husbands eczema you have not rats in the house i hope oh dear no what a horrid idea that is a good thing i was told you had i am glad to know it is not true because i have a perfect horror of the creatures and i should never have come to see you again goodbye my dear child we shall meet again soon you know what a pleasure it is to me to see you you do not know how to put your chrysanthemums in water she went on as she prepared to leave the room mme swann having risen to escort her they are japanese flowers you must arrange them the same way as the japanese i do not agree with mme verdurin although she is the law and the prophets to me in all things there is no one like you odette for finding such lovely chrysanthemums or chrysanthema rather for it seems that is what we ought to call them now declared mme cottard as soon as the mistress had shut the door behind her dear mme verdurin is not always very kind about other peoples flowers said odette sweetly whom do you go to odette asked mme cottard to forestall any further criticism of the mistress lemaître i must confess the other day in lemaîtres window i saw a huge great pink bush which made me do something quite mad but modesty forbade her to give any more precise details as to the price of the bush and she said merely that the professor and you know he is not at all a quicktempered man had waved his sword in the air and told her that she did not know what money meant no no i have no regular florist except debac nor have i said mme cottard but i confess that i am unfaithful to him now and then with lachaume oh you forsake him for lachaume do you i must tell debac that retorted odette always anxious to shew her wit and to lead the conversation in her own house where she felt more at her ease than in the little clan besides lachaume is really becoming too dear his prices are quite excessive do not you know i find his prices impossible she added laughing meanwhile mme bontemps who had been heard a hundred times to declare that nothing would induce her to go to the verdurins delighted at being asked to the famous wednesdays was planning in her own mind how she could manage to attend as many of them as possible she was not aware that mme verdurin liked people not to miss a single one also she was one of those people whose company is but little sought who when a hostess invites them to a series of parties do not accept and go to them without more ado like those who know that it is always a pleasure to see them whenever they have a moment to spare and feel inclined to go out people of her type deny themselves it may be the first evening and the third imagining that their absence will be noticed and save themselves up for the second and fourth unless it should happen that having heard from a trustworthy source that the third is to be a particularly brilliant party they re the original order assuring their hostess that most unfortunately we had another engagement last week so mme bontemps was calculating how many wednesdays there could still be left before easter and by what means she might manage to secure one extra and yet not appear to be thrusting herself upon her hostess she relied upon mme cottard whom she would have with her in the carriage going home to give her a few hints oh mme bontemps i see you getting up to go it is very bad of you to give the signal for flight like that you owe me some compensation for not turning up last thursday come sit down again just for a minute you cannot possibly be going anywhere else before dinner really you will not let yourself be tempted went on mme swann and as she held out a plate of cakes you know they are not at all bad these little horrors they do not look nice but just taste one i know you will like it on the contrary they look quite delicious broke in mme cottard in your house odette one is never short of victuals i have no need to ask to see the trademark i know you get everything from rebattet i must say that i am more eclectic for sweet biscuits and everything of that sort i repair as often as not to bourbonneux but i agree that they simply do not know what an ice means rebattet for everything iced and syrups and sorbets they are past masters as my husband would say they are the ne plus ultra oh but we just make these in the house you will not really i shall not be able to eat a scrap of dinner pleaded mme bontemps but i will just sit down again for a moment you know i adore talking to a clever woman like you you will think me highly indiscreet odette but i should so like to know what you thought of the hat mme trombert had on i know of course that big hats are the fashion just now all the same was not it just the least little bit exaggerated and compared to the hat she came to see me in the other day the one she had on just now was microscopic oh no i am not at all clever said odette thinking that this sounded well i am a perfect simpleton i believe everything people say and worry myself to death over the least thing and she insinuated that she had just at first suffered terribly from the thought of having married a man like swann who had a separate life of his own and was unfaithful to her meanwhile the prince dagrigente having caught the words i am not at all clever thought it incumbent on him to protest unfortunately he had not the knack of repartee tut tut tut tut cried mme bontemps not clever you that is just what i was saying to myself what do i hear the prince clutched at this straw my ears must have played me false no i assure you went on odette i am really just an ordinary woman very easily shocked full of prejudices living in my own little groove and dreadfully ignorant and then in case he had any news of the baron de charlus have you seen our dear baronet she asked him you ignorant cried mme bontemps then i wonder what you would say of the official world all those wives of excellencies who can talk of nothing but their frocks listen to this my friend not more than a week ago i happened to mention lohengrin to the education ministers wife she stared at me and said lohengrin oh yes the new review at the foliesbergeres i hear it is a perfect scream what do you say to that eh you cannot help yourself when people say things like that it makes your blood boil i could have struck her because i have a bit of a temper of my own what do you say sir she turned to me was i not right listen said mme cottard people cannot help answering a little off the mark when they are asked a thing like that point blank without any warning i know something about it because mme verdurin also has a habit of putting a pistol to your head speaking of mme verdurin mme bontemps asked mme cottard do you know who will be there on wednesday oh i have just remembered that we have accepted an invitation for next wednesday you would not care to dine with us on wednesday week we could go on together to mme verdurins i should never dare to go there by myself i do not know why it is that great lady always terrifies me i will tell you what it is replied mme cottard what frightens you about mme verdurin is her organ but you see everyone cannot have such a charming organ as mme swann once you have found your tongue as the mistress says the ice will soon be broken for she is a very easy person really to get on with but i can quite understand what you feel it is never pleasant to find oneself for the first time in a strange country will not you dine with us too said mme bontemps to mme swann after dinner we could all go to the verdurins together do a verdurin and even if it means that the mistress will stare me out of countenance and never ask me to the house again once we are there we will just sit by ourselves and have a quiet talk i am sure that is what i should like best but this assertion can hardly have been quite truthful for mme bontemps went on to ask who do you think will be there on wednesday week what will they be doing there will not be too big a crowd i hope i certainly shall not be there said odette we shall just look in for a minute on the last wednesday of all if you do not mind waiting till then but mme bontemps did not appear to be tempted by the proposal granted that the intellectual distinction of a house and its smartness are generally in in rather than direct ratio one must suppose since swann found mme bontemps attractive that any forfeiture of position once accepted has the consequence of making us less particular with regard to the people among whom we have resigned ourselves to finding entertainment less particular with regard to their intelligence as to everything else about them and if this be true men like nations must see their culture and even their language disappear with their independence one of the effects of this indulgence is to aggravate the tendency which after a certain age we have towards finding pleasure in speeches that are a homage to our own turn of mind to our weaknesses an encouragement to us to yield to them that is the age at which a great artist prefers to the company of original minds that of pupils who have nothing in common with him save the letter of his doctrine who listen to him and offer incense at which a man or woman of mark who is living entirely for love will find that the most intelligent person in a gathering is one perhaps of no distinction but one who has shewn by some utterance that he can understand and approve what is meant by an existence devoted to gallantry and has thus pleasantly excited the voluptuous instincts of the lover or mistress it was the age too at which swann in so far as he had become the husband of odette enjoyed hearing mme bontemps say how silly it was to have nobody in ones house but duchesses concluding from that quite the contrary of what he would have decided in the old days at the verdurins that she was a good creature extremely sensible and not at all a snob and telling her stories which made her die laughing because she had not heard them before although she always saw the point at once liked flattering her for his own amusement then the doctor is not mad about flowers like you mme swann asked mme cottard oh well you know my husband is a sage be practises moderation in all things yet i must admit he has a passion her eye aflame with malice joy curiosity and what is that pray inquired mme bontemps quite simply mme cottard answered her reading oh that is a very restful passion in a husband cried mme bontemps suppressing an impish laugh when the doctor gets a book in his hands you know well that need not alarm you much but it does for his eyesight i must go now and look after him odette and i shall come back on the very first opportunity and knock at your door talking of eyesight have you heard that the new house mme verdurin has just bought is to be lighted by electricity i did not get that from my own little secret service you know but from quite a different source it was the electrician himself mildé who told me you see i quote my authorities even the bedrooms he says are to have electric lamps with shades which will filter the light it is evidently a charming luxury for those who can afford it but it seems that our contemporaries must absolutely have the newest thing if it is the only one of its kind in the world just fancy the sisterinlaw of a friend of mine has had the telephone installed in her house she can order things from her tradesmen without having to go out of doors i confess that i have made the most barefaced stratagems to get permission to go there one day just to speak into the instrument it is very tempting but more in a friends house than at home i do not think i should like to have the telephone in my establishment once the first excitement is over it must be a perfect racket going on all the time now odette i must be off you are not to keep mme bontemps any longer she is looking after me i must absolutely tear myself away you are making me behave in a nice way i shall be getting home after my husband and for myself also it was time to return home before i had tasted those wintry delights of which the chrysanthemums had seemed to me to be the brilliant envelope these pleasures had not appeared and yet mme swann did not look as though she expected anything more she allowed the servants to carry away the teathings as who should say time please gentlemen and at last she did say to me really must you go very well goodbye i felt that i might have stayed there without encountering those unknown pleasures and that my unhappiness was not the because of my having to forego them were they to be found then situated not upon that beaten track of hours which leads one always to the moment of departure but rather upon some crossroad unknown to me along which i ought to have digressed at least the object of my visit had been attained gilberte would know that i had come to see her parents when she was not at home and that i had as mme cottard had incessantly assured me made a complete conquest first shot of mme verdurin whom she added she had never seen make so much of anyone you and she must have hooked atoms she would know that i had spoken of her as was fitting with affection but that i had not that incapacity for living without our seeing one another which i believed to be at the root of the boredom that she had shewn at our last meetings i had told mme swann that i should not be able to see gilberte again i had said this as though i had finally decided not to see her any more and the letter which i was going to send gilberte would be framed on those lines only to myself to fortify my courage i proposed no more than a supreme and concentrated effort lasting a few days only i said to myself this is the last time that i shall refuse to meet her i shall accept the next invitation to make our separation less difficult to realise i did not picture it to myself as final but i knew very well that it would be the first of january was exceptionally painful to me that winter so no doubt is everything that marks a date and an anniversary when we are unhappy but if our unhappiness is due to the loss of some dear friend our suffering consists merely in an unusually vivid comparison of the present with the past there was added to this in my case the unexpressed hope that gilberte having intended to leave me to take the first steps towards a reconciliation and discovering that i had not taken them had been waiting only for the excuse of new years day to write to me saying what is the matter i am madly in love with you come and let us explain things properly i cannot live without seeing you as the last days of the old year went by such a letter began to seem probable it was perhaps nothing of the sort but to make us believe that such a thing is probable the desire the need that we have for it suffices the soldier is convinced that a certain interval of time capable of being indefinitely prolonged will be allowed him before the bullet finds him the thief before he is taken men in general before they have to die that is the amulet which preserves people and sometimes peoples not from danger but from the fear of danger in reality from the belief in danger which in certain cases allows them to brave it without their actually needing to be brave it is confidence of this sort and with as little foundation that sustains the lover who is counting upon a reconciliation upon a letter for me to cease to expect a letter it would have sufficed that i should have ceased to wish for one however unimportant one may know that one is in the eyes of her whom one still loves one attributes to her a series of thoughts though their sumtotal be indifference the intention to express those thoughts a complication of her inner life in which one is the constant object possibly of her antipathy but certainly of her attention but to imagine what was going on in gilbertes mind i should have required simply the power to anticipate on that new years day what i should feel on the first day of any of the years to come when the attention or the silence or the affection or the coldness of gilberte would pass almost unnoticed by me and i should not dream should not even be able to dream of seeking a solution of problems which would have ceased to perplex me when we are in love our love is too big a thing for us to be able altogether to contain it within us it radiates towards the beloved object finds in her a surface which arrests it forcing it to return to its startingpoint and it is this shock of the repercussion of our own affection which we call the others regard for ourselves and which pleases us more then than on its outward journey because we do not recognise it as having originated in ourselves new years day rang out all its hours without there coming to me that letter from gilberte and as i received a few others containing greetings tardy or retarded by the overburdening of the mails at that season on the third and fourth of january i hoped still but my hope grew hourly more faint upon the days that followed i gazed through a mist of tears this undoubtedly meant that having been less sincere than i thought in my renunciation of gilberte i had kept the hope of a letter from her for the new year and seeing that hope exhausted before i had had time to shelter myself behind another i suffered as would an invalid who had emptied his phial of morphia without having another within his reach but perhaps also in my case and these two explanations are not mutually exclusive for a single feeling is often made up of contrary elements the hope that i entertained of ultimately receiving a letter had brought to my minds eye once again the image of gilberte had reawakened the emotions which the expectation of finding myself in her presence the sight of her her way of treating me had aroused in me before the immediate possibility of a reconciliation had suppressed in me that faculty the immense importance of which we are apt to overlook the faculty of resignation neurasthenics find it impossible to believe the friends who assure them that they will gradually recover their peace of mind if they will stay in bed and receive no letters read no newspapers they imagine that such a course will only exasperate their twitching nerves and similarly lovers who look upon it from their enclosure in a contrary state of mind who have not begun yet to make trial of it are unable to believe in the healing power of renunciation in consequence of the violence of my palpitations my doses of caffeine were reduced the palpitations ceased whereupon i asked myself whether it was not to some extent the drug that had been responsible for the anguish that i had felt when i came near to quarrelling with gilberte an anguish which i had attributed on every recurrence of it to the distressing prospect of never seeing my friend again or of running the risk of seeing her only when she was a prey to the same illhumour but if this medicine had been at the root of the sufferings which my imagination must in that case have interpreted wrongly not that there would be anything extraordinary in that seeing that among lovers the most acute mental suffering assumes often the physical identity of the woman with whom they are living it had been in that sense like the philtre which long after they have drunk of it continues to bind tristan to isolde for the physical improvement which the reduction of my caffeine effected almost at once did not arrest the evolution of that grief which my absorption of the toxin had perhaps if it had not created it at any rate contrived to render more acute only as the middle of the month of january approached once my hopes of a letter on new years day had been disappointed once the additional disturbance that had come with their disappointment had grown calm it was my old sorrow that of before the holidays which began again what was perhaps the most cruel thing about it was that i myself was its architect unconscious wilful merciless and patient the one thing that mattered my relations with gilberte it was i who was labouring to make them impossible by gradually creating out of this prolonged separation from my friend not indeed her indifference but what would come to the same thing in the end my own it was to a slow and painful suicide of that part of me which was gilbertes lover that i was goading myself with untiring energy with a clear sense not only of what i was presently doing but of what must result from it in the future i knew not only that after a certain time i should cease to love gilberte but also that she herself would regret it and that the attempts which she would then make to see me would be as vain as those that she was making now no longer because i loved her too well but because i should certainly be in love with some other woman whom i should continue to desire to wait for through hours of which i should not dare to divert any particle of a second to gilberte who would be nothing to me then and no doubt at that very moment in which since i was determined not to see her again unless after a formal request for an explanation or a full confession of love on her part neither of which was in the least degree likely to come to me now i had already lost gilberte and loved her more than ever and could feel all that she was to me better than in the previous year when spending all my afternoons in her company or as many as i chose i believed that no peril threatened our friendship no doubt at that moment the idea that i should one day entertain identical feelings for another was odious to me for that idea carried me away beyond the range of gilberte my love and my sufferings my love my sufferings in which through my tears i attempted to discern precisely what gilberte was and was obliged to recognise that they did not pertain exclusively to her but would sooner or later be some other womans portion so that or such at least was my way of thinking then we are always detached from our fellowcreatures when a man loves one of them he feels that his love is not labelled with their two names but may be born again in the future may have been born already in the past for another and not for her and in the time when he is not in love if he makes up his mind philosophically as to what it is that is inconsistent in love he will find that the love of which he can speak unmoved he did not at the moment of speaking feel and therefore did not know knowledge in these matters being intermittent and not outlasting the actual presence of the sentiment that future in which i should not love gilberte which my sufferings helped me to divine although my imagination was not yet able to form a clear picture of it certainly there would still have been time to warn gilberte that it was gradually taking shape that its coming was if not imminent at least inevitable if she herself gilberte did not come to my rescue and destroy in the germ my nascent indifference how often was i not on the point of writing or of going to gilberte to tell her take care my mind is made up what i am doing now is my supreme effort i am seeing you now for the last time very soon i shall have ceased to love you but to what end by what authority should i have reproached gilberte for an indifference which not that i considered myself guilty on that count i too manifested towards everything that was not herself the last time to me that appeared as something of immense significance because i was in love with gilberte on her it would doubtless have made just as much impression as those letters in which our friends ask whether they may pay us a visit before they finally leave the country an offer which like those made by tiresome women who are in love with us we decline because we have pleasures of our own in prospect the time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic the passions that we feel expand it those that we inspire contract it and habit fills up what remains besides what good would it have done if i had spoken to gilberte she would not have understood me we imagine always when we speak that it is our own ears our own mind that are listening my words would have come to her only in a distorted form as though they had had to pass through the moving curtain of a waterfall before they reached my friend unrecognisable giving a foolish sound having no longer any kind of meaning the truth which one puts into ones words does not make a direct path for itself is not supported by irresistible evidence a considerable time must elapse before a truth of the same order can take shape in the words themselves then the political opponent who despite all argument every proof that he has advanced to damn the votary of the rival doctrine as a traitor will himself have come to share the hated conviction by which he who once sought in vain to disseminate it is no longer bound then the masterpiece of literature whidi for the admirers who read it aloud seemed to make selfevident the proofs of its excellence while to those who listened it presented only a senseless or commonplace image will by these too be proclaimed a masterpiece but too late for the author to learn of their discovery similarly in love the barriers do what one may cannot be broken down from without by him whom they maddeningly exclude it is when he is no longer concerned with them that suddenly as the result of aft effort directed from elsewhere accomplished within the heart of her who did not love him those barriers which he has charged without success will fall to no advantage if i had come to gilberte to tell her of my future indifference and the means of preventing it she would have assumed from my action that my love for her the need that i had of her were even greater than i had supposed and her distaste for the sight of me would thereby have been increased and incidentally it is quite true that it was that love for her which helped me by means of the incongruous states of mind which it successively produced in me to foresee more clearly than she herself could the end of that love and yet some such warning i might perhaps have addressed by letter or with my own lips to gilberte after a long enough interval which would render her it is true less indispensable to me but would also have proved to her that she was not so indispensable unfortunately certain persons of good or evil intent spoke of me to her in a fashion which must have led her to think that they were doing so at my request whenever i thus learned that cottard my own mother even m de norpois had by a few illchosen words rendered useless all the sacrifice that i had just been making wasted all the advantage of my reserve by giving me wrongly the appearance of having emerged from it i was doubly angry in the first place i could no longer reckon from any date but the present my laborious and fruitful abstention which these tiresome people had unknown to me interrupted and so brought to nothing and not only that i should have less pleasure in seeing gilberte who would think of me now no longer as containing myself in dignified resignation but as plotting in the dark for an interview which she had scorned to grant me i cursed all the idle chatter of people who so often without any intention of hurting us or of doing us a service for no reason for talkings sake often because we ourselves have not been able to refrain from talking in their presence and because they are indiscreet as we ourselves are do us at a crucial moment so much harm it is true that in the grim operation performed for the eradication of our love they are far from playing a part equal to that played by two persons who are in the habit from excess of good nature in one and of malice in the other of undoing everything at the moment when everything is on the point of being settled but against these two persons we bear no such grudge as against the inopportune cottards of this world for the latter of them is the person whom we love and the former is ourself meanwhile since on almost every occasion of my going to see her mme swann would invite me to come to tea another day with her daughter and tell me to reply directly to her i was constantly writing to gilberte and in this correspondence i did not choose the expressions which might i felt have won her over sought only to carve out the easiest channel for the torrent of my tears for like desire regret seeks not to be analysed but to be satisfied when one begins to love one spends ones time not in getting to know what ones love really is but in making it possible to meet next day when one abandons love one seeks not to know ones grief but to offer to her who is causing it that expression of it which seems to one the most moving one says the things which one feels the need of saying and which the other will not understand one speaks for oneself alone i wrote i had thought that it would not be possible alas i see now that it is not so difficult i said also i shall probably not see you again i said it while i continued to avoid shewing a coldness which she might think affected and the words as i wrote them made me weep because i felt that they expressed not what i should have liked to believe but what was probably going to happen for at the next request for a meeting which she would convey to me i should have again as i had now the courage not to yield and what with one refusal and another i should gradually come to the moment when by virtue of not having seen her again i should not wish to see her i wept but i found courage enough to sacrifice i tasted the sweets of sacrificing the happiness of being with her to the probability of seeming attractive to her one day a day when alas my seeming attractive to her would be immaterial to me even the supposition albeit so far from likely that at this moment as she had pretended during the last visit that i had paid her she loved me that what i took for the boredom which one feels in the company of a person of whom one has grown tired had been due only to a jealous susceptibility to a feint of indifference analogous to my own only rendered my decision less painful it seemed to me that in years to come when we had forgotten one another when i should be able to look back and tell her that this letter which i was now in course of writing had not been for one moment sincere she would answer what you really did love me did you if you had only known how i waited for that letter how i hoped that you were coming to see me how i cried when i read it the thought while i was writing it immediately on my return from her mothers house that i was perhaps helping to bring about that very misunderstanding that thought by the sadness in which it plunged me by the pleasure of imagining that i was loved by gilberte gave me the impulse to continue my letter if at the moment of leaving mme swann when her teaparty ended i was thinking of what i was going to write to her daughter mme cottard as she departed had been filled with thoughts of a wholly different order on her little tour of inspection she had not failed to congratulate mme swann on the new pieces the recent acquisitions which caught the eye in her drawingroom she could see among them some though only a very few of the things that odette had had in the old days in the rue la pérouse for instance her animals carved in precious stones her fetishes for since mme swann had picked up from a friend whose opinion she valued the word dowdy which had opened to her a new horizon because it denoted precisely those things which a few years earlier she had considered smart all those things had one after another followed into retirement the gilded trellis that had served as background to her chrysanthemums innumerable boxes of sweets from girouxs and the coroneted notepaper not to mention the coins of gilt pasteboard littered about on the mantelpieces which even before she had come to know swann a man of taste had advised her to sacrifice moreover in the artistic disorder the studiolike confusion of the rooms whose walls were still painted in sombre colours which made them as different as possible from the whiteenamelled drawingrooms in which a little later you were to find mme swann installed the far east recoiled more and more before the invading forces of the eighteenth century and the cushions which to make me comfortable mme swann heaped up and buffeted into position behind my back were sprinkled with louis xv garlands and not as of old with chinese dragons in the room in which she was usually to be found and of which she would say yes i like this room i use it a great deal i could not live with a lot of horrid vulgar things swearing at me all the time this is where i do my work though she never stated precisely at what she was working was it a picture a book perhaps for the hobby of writing was beginning to become common among women who liked to do something not to be quite useless she was surrounded by dresden pieces having a fancy for that sort of porcelain which she would name with an english accent saying in any connexion how pretty that is it reminds me of dresden flowers and dreaded for them even more than in the old days for her grotesque figures and her flowerpots the ignorant handling of her servants who must expiate every now and then the anxiety that they had caused her by submitting to outbursts of rage at which swann the most courteous and considerate of masters looked on without being shocked not that the clear perception of certain weaknesses in those whom we love in any way diminishes our affection for them rather that affection makes us find those weaknesses charming rarely nowadays was it in one of those japanese wrappers that odette received her familiars but rather in the bright and billowing silk of a watteau gown whose flowering foam she made as though to caress where it covered her bosom and in which she immersed herself looked solemn splashed and sported with such an air of comfort of a cool skin and longdrawn breath that she seemed to look on these garments not as something decorative a mere setting for herself but as necessary in the same way as her tub or her daily outing to satisfy the requirements of her style of beauty and the niceties of hygiene she used often to say that she would go without bread rather than give up art and having nice things about her and that the burning of the gioconda would distress her infinitely more than the destruction by the same element of millions of the people she knew theories which seemed paradoxical to her friends but made her pass among them as a superior woman and qualified her to receive a visit once a week from the belgian minister so that in the little world whose sun she was everyone would have been greatly astonished to learn that elsewhere at the verdurins for instance she was reckoned a fool it was this vivacity of expression that made mme swann prefer mens society to womens but when she criticised the latter it was always from the courtesans standpoint singling out the blemishes that might lower them in the esteem of men a lumpy figure a bad complexion inability to spell hairy legs foul breath pencilled eyebrows but towards a woman who had shewn her kindness or indulgence in the past she was more lenient especially if this woman were now in trouble she would defend her warmly saying people are not fair to her i assure you she is quite a nice woman really it was not only the furniture of odettes drawingroom it was odette herself that mme cottard and all those who had frequented the society of mme de crécy would have found it difficult if they had not seen her for some little time to recognise she seemed to be so much younger no doubt this was partly because she had grown stouter was in better condition seemed at once calmer more cool more restful and also because the new way in which she braided her hair gave more breadth to a face which was animated by an application of pink powder and into which her eyes and profile formerly too prominent seemed now to have been reabsorbed but another reason for this change lay in the fact that having reached the turningpoint of life odette had at length discovered or invented a physiognomy of her own an unalterable character a style of beauty and on her incoherent features which for so long exposed to every hazard every weakness of the flesh borrowing for a moment at the slightest fatigue from the years to come a sort of flickering shadow of anility had furnished her well or ill according to how she was feeling how she was looking with a countenance dishevelled inconstant formless and attractive had now set this fixed type as it were an immortal youthfulness swann had in his room instead of the handsome photographs that were now taken of his wife in all of which the same cryptic victorious expression enabled one to recognise in whatever dress and hat her triumphant face and figure a little old daguerreotype of her quite plain taken long before the appearance of this new type so that the youth and beauty of odette which she had not yet discovered when it was taken appeared to be missing from it but it is probable that swann having remained constant or having reverted to a different conception of her enjoyed in the slender young woman with pensive eyes and tired features caught in a pose between rest and motion a more botticellian charm for he still liked to recognise in his wife one of botticellis figures odette who on the other hand sought not to bring out but to make up for to cover and conceal the points in herself that did not please her what might perhaps to an artist express her character but in her womans eyes were merely blemishes would not have that painter mentioned in her presence swann had a wonderful scarf of oriental silk blue and pink which he had bought because it was exactly that worn by our lady in the magnificat but mme swann refused to wear it once only she allowed her husband to order her a dress covered all over with daisies cornflowers forgetmenots and campanulas like that of the primavera and sometimes in the evening when she was tired he would quietly draw my attention to the way in which she was giving quite unconsciously to her pensive hands the uncontrolled almost distraught movement of the virgin who dips her pen into the inkpot that the angel holds out to her before writing upon the sacred page on which is already traced the word magnificat but he added whatever you do do not say anything about it to her if she knew she was doing it she would change her pose at once save at these moments of involuntary relaxation in which swann essayed to recapture the melancholy cadence of botticelli odette seemed now to be cut out in a single figure wholly confined within a line which following the contours of the woman had abandoned the winding paths the capricious reentrants and salients the radial points the elaborate dispersions of the fashions of former days but also where it was her anatomy that went wrong by making unnecessary digressions within or without the ideal circumference traced for it was able to rectify by a bold stroke the errors of nature to make up along a whole section of its course for the failure as well of the human as of the textile element the pads the preposterous bustle had disappeared as well as those tailed corsets which projecting under the skirt and stiffened by rods of whalebone had so long amplified odette with an artificial stomach and had given her the appearance of being composed of several incongruous pieces which there was no individuality to bind together the vertical fall of fringes the curve of trimmings had made way for the inflexion of a body which made silk palpitate as a siren stirs the waves gave to cambric a human expression now that it had been liberated like a creature that had taken shape and drawn breath from the long chaos and nebulous envelopment of fashions at length dethroned but mme swann had chosen had contrived to preserve some vestiges of certain of these in the very thick of the more recent fashions that had supplanted them when in the evening finding myself unable to work and feeling certain that gilberte had gone to the theatre with friends i paid a surprise visit to her parents i used often to find mme swann in an elegant dishabille the skirt of which of one of those rich dark colours bloodred or orange which seemed always as though they meant something very special because they were no longer the fashion was crossed diagonally though not concealed by a broad band of black lace which recalled the flounces of an earlier day when on a still chilly afternoon in spring she had taken me before my rupture with her daughter to the jardin dacclimatation under her coat which she opened or buttoned up according as the exercise made her feel warm the dogtoothed border of her blouse suggested a glimpse of the lapel of some nonexistent waistcoat such as she had been accustomed to wear some years earlier when she had liked their edges to have the same slight indentations and her scarf of that same scotch tartan to which she had remained faithful but whose tones she had so far softened red becoming pink and blue lilac that one might almost have taken it for one of those pigeonsbreast taffetas which were the latest novelty was knotted in such a way under her chin without ones being able to make out where it was fastened that one could not help being reminded of those bonnetstrings which were now no longer worn she need only hold out like this for a little longer and young men attempting to understand her theory of dress would say mme swann is quite a period in herself is not she as in a fine literary style which overlays with its different forms and so strengthens a tradition which lies concealed among them so in mme swanns attire those halfhinted memories of waistcoats or of ringlets sometimes a tendency at once repressed towards the all aboard or even a distant and vague allusion to the chase me kept alive beneath the concrete form the unfinished likeness of other older forms which you would not have succeeded now in making a tailor or a dressmaker reproduce but about which your thoughts incessantly hovered and enwrapped mme swann in a cloak of nobility perhaps because the sheer uselessness of these fripperies made them seem meant to serve some more than utilitarian purpose perhaps because of the traces they preserved of vanished years or else because there was a sort of personality permeating this ladys wardrobe which gave to the most dissimilar of her costumes a distinct family likeness one felt that she did not dress simply for the comfort or the adornment of her body she was surrounded by her garments as by the delicate and spiritualised machinery of a whole form of civilisation when gilberte who as a rule gave her teaparties on the days when her mother was at home had for some reason to go out and i was therefore free to attend mme swanns kettledrum i would find her dressed in one of her lovely gowns some of which were of taffeta others of grosgrain or of velvet or of crepedechine or satin or silk gowns which not being loose like those that she generally wore in the house but buttoned up tight as though she were just going out in them gave to her stayathome laziness on those afternoons something alert and energetic and no doubt the daring simplicity of their cut was singularly appropriate to her figure and to her movements which her sleeves appeared to be symbolising in colours that varied from day to day one would have said that there was a sudden determination in the blue velvet an easygoing good humour in the white taffeta and that a sort of supreme discretion full of dignity in her way of holding out her arm had in order to become visible put on the appearance dazzling with the smile of one who had made great sacrifices of the black crepedechine but at the same time these animated gowns took from the complication of their trimmings none of which had any practical value or served any conceivable purpose something detached pensive secret in harmony with the melancholy which mme swann never failed to shew at least in the shadows under her eyes and the drooping arches of her hands beneath the profusion of sapphire charms enamelled fourleaf clovers silver medals gold medallions turquoise amulets ruby chains and topaz chestnuts there would be on the dress itself some design carried out in colour which pursued across the surface of an inserted panel a preconceived existence of its own some row of little satin buttons which buttoned nothing and could not be unbuttoned a strip of braid that sought to please the eye with the minuteness the discretion of a delicate reminder and these as well as the trinkets had the effect for otherwise there would have been no possible justification of their presence of disclosing a secret intention being a pledge of affection keeping a secret ministering to a superstition commemorating a recovery from sickness a granted wish a love affair or a philippine and now and then in the blue velvet of the bodice a hint of slashes in the henri ii style in the gown of black satin a slight swelling which if it was in the sleeves just below the shoulders made one think of the leg of mutton sleeves of or if on the other hand it was beneath the skirt with its louis xv paniers gave the dress a just perceptible air of being fancy dress and at all events by insinuating beneath the life of the present day a vague reminiscence of the past blended with the person of mme swann the charm of certain heroines of history or romance and if i were to draw her attention to this i do not play golf she would answer like so many of my friends so i should have no excuse for going about as they do in sweaters in the confusion of her drawingroom on her way from shewing out one visitor or with a plateful of cakes to tempt another mme swann as she passed by me would take me aside for a moment i have special instructions from gilberte that you are to come to luncheon the day after tomorrow as i was not sure of seeing you here i was going to write to you if you had not come i continued to resist and this resistance was costing me steadily less and less because however much one may love the poison that is destroying one when one has compulsorily to do without it and has had to do without it for some time past one cannot help attaching a certain value to the peace of mind which one had ceased to know to the absence of emotion and suffering if one is not altogether sincere in assuring oneself that one does not wish ever to see again her whom one loves one would not be a whit more sincere in saying that one would like to see her for no doubt one can endure her absence only when one promises oneself that it shall not be for long and thinks of the day on which one shall see her again but at the same time one feels how much less painful are those daily recurring dreams of a meeting immediate and incessantly postponed than would be an interview which might be followed by a spasm of jealousy with the result that the news that one is shortly to see her whom one loves would because a disturbance which would be none too pleasant what one procrastinates now from day to day is no longer the end of the intolerable anxiety caused by separation it is the dreaded renewal of emotions which can lead to nothing how infinitely one prefers to any such interview the docile memory which one can supplement at ones pleasure with dreams in which she who in reality does not love one seems far from that to be making protestations of her love for one when one is by oneself that memory which one can contrive by blending gradually with it a portion of what one desires to render as pleasing as one may choose how infinitely one prefers it to the avoided interview in which one would have to deal with a creature to whom one could no longer dictate at ones pleasure the words that one would like to hear on her lips but from whom one would meet with fresh coldness unlookedfor violence we know all of us when we no longer love that forgetfulness that even a vague memory do not because us so much suffering as an illstarred love it was of such forgetfulness that in anticipation i preferred without acknowledging it to myself the reposeful tranquillity moreover whatever discomfort there may be in such a course of psychical detachment and isolation grows steadily less for another reason namely that it weakens while it is in process of healing that fixed obsession which is a state of love mine was still strong enough for me to be able to count upon recapturing my old position in gilbertes estimation which in view of my deliberate abstention must it seemed to me be steadily increasing in other words each of those calm and melancholy days on which i did not see her coming one after the other without interruption continuing too without prescription unless some busybody were to meddle in my affairs was a day not lost but gained gained to no purpose it might be for presently they would be able to pronounce that i was healed resignation modulating our habits allows certain elements of our strength to be indefinitely increased those so wretchedly inadequate that i had had to support my grief on the first evening of my rupture with gilberte had since multiplied to an incalculable power only the tendency which everything that exists has to prolong its own existence is sometimes interrupted by sudden impulses to which we give way with all the fewer scruples over letting ourselves go since we know for how many days for how many months even we have been able and might still be able to abstain and often it is when the purse in which we hoard our savings is nearly full that we undo and empty it it is without waiting for the result of our medical treatment and when we have succeeded in growing accustomed to it that we abandon it so one day when mme swann was repeating her familiar statement of what a pleasure it would be to gilberte to see me thus putting the happiness of which i had now for so long been depriving myself as it were within arms length i was stupefied by the realisation that it was still possible for me to enjoy that pleasure and i could hardly wait until next day when i had made up my mind to take gilberte by surprise in the evening before dinner what helped me to remain patient throughout the long day that followed was another plan that i had made from the moment in which everything was forgotten in which i was reconciled to gilberte i no longer wished to visit her save as a lover every day she should receive from me the finest flowers that grew and if mme swann albeit she had no right to be too severe a mother should forbid my making a daily offering of flowers i should find other gifts more precious and less frequent my parents did not give me enough money for me to be able to buy expensive things i thought of a big bowl of old chinese porcelain which had been left to me by aunt léonie and of which mamma prophesied daily that françoise would come running to her with an oh it is all come to pieces and that that would be the end of it would it not be wiser in that case to part with it to sell it so as to be able to give gilberte all the pleasure i could i felt sure that i could easily get a thousand francs for it i had it tied up in paper i had grown so used to it that i had ceased altogether to notice it parting with it had at least the advantage of making me realise what it was like i took it with me as i started for the swanns and giving the driver their address told him to go by the champselysées at one end of which was the shop of a big dealer in oriental things who knew my father greatly to my surprise he offered me there and then not one thousand but ten thousand francs for the bowl i took the notes with rapture every day for a whole year i could smother gilberte in roses and lilac when i left the shop and got into my cab again the driver naturally enough since the swanns lived out by the bois instead of taking the ordinary way began to drive me along the avenue des champselysées he had just passed the end of the rue de berri when in the failing light i thought i saw close to the swanns house but going in the other direction going away from it gilberte who was walking slowly though with a firm step by the side of a young man with whom she was conversing but whose face i could not distinguish i stood up in the cab meaning to tell the driver to stop then hesitated the strolling couple were already some way away and the parallel lines which their leisurely progress was quietly drawing were on the verge of disappearing in the elysian gloom a moment later i had reached gilbertes door i was received by mme swann oh she will be sorry was my greeting i cannot think why she is not in she came home just now from a lesson complaining of the heat and said she was going out for a little fresh air with another girl i fancy i passed her in the avenue des champselysées oh i do not think it can have been anyhow do not mention it to her father he does not approve of her going out at this time of night must you go goodbye i left her told my driver to go home the same way but found no trace of the two walking figures where had they been what were they saying to one another in the darkness so confidentially i returned home desperately clutching my windfall of ten thousand francs which would have enabled me to arrange so many pleasant surprises for that gilberte whom now i had made up my mind never to see again no doubt my call at the dealers had brought me happiness by allowing me to expect that in future whenever i saw my friend she would be pleased with me and grateful but if i had not called there if my cabman had not taken the avenue des champselysées i should not have seen gilberte with that young man thus a single action may have two contradictory effects and the misfortune that it engenders cancel the good fortune that it has already brought one there had befallen me the opposite of what so frequently happens we desire some pleasure and the material means of obtaining it are lacking it is a mistake labruyere tells us to be in love without an ample fortune there is nothing for it but to attempt a gradual elimination of our desire for that pleasure in my case however the material means had been forthcoming but at the same moment if not by a logical effect at any rate as a fortuitous consequence of that initial success my pleasure had been snatched from me as for that matter it seems as though it must always be as a rule however not on the same evening on which we have acquired what makes it possible usually we continue to struggle and to hope for a little longer but the pleasure can never be realised if we succeed in overcoming the force of circumstances nature at once shifts the battleground placing it within ourselves and effects a gradual change in our heart until it desires something other than what it is going to obtain and if this transposition has been so rapid that our heart has not had time to change nature does not on that account despair of conquering us in a manner more gradual it is true more subtle but no less efficacious it is then at the last moment that the possession of our happiness is wrested from us or rather it is that very possession which nature with diabolical cleverness uses to destroy our happiness after failure in every quarter of the domain of life and action it is a final incapacity the mental incapacity for happiness that nature creates in us the phenomenon of happiness either fails to appear or at once gives way to the bitterest of reactions i put my ten thousand francs in a drawer but they were no longer of any use to me i ran through them as it happened even sooner than if i had sent flowers every day to gilberte for when evening came i was always too wretched to stay in the house and used to go and pour out my sorrows upon the bosoms of women whom i did not love as for seeking to give any sort of pleasure to gilberte i no longer thought of that to visit her house again now could only have added to my sufferings even the sight of gilberte which would have been so exquisite a pleasure only yesterday would no longer have sufficed me for i should have been miserable all the time that i was not actually with her that is how a woman by every fresh torture that she inflicts on us increases often quite unconsciously her power over us and at the same time our demands upon her with each injury that she does us she encircles us more and more completely doubles our chains but halves the strength of those which hitherto we had thought adequate to bind her in order that we might retain our own peace of mind only yesterday had i not been afraid of annoying gilberte i should have been content to ask for no more than occasional meetings which now would no longer have contented me and for which i should now have substituted quite different terms for in this respect love is not like war after the battle is ended we renew the fight with keener ardour which we never cease to intensify the more thoroughly we are defeated provided always that we are still in a position to give battle this was not my position with regard to gilberte also i preferred at first not to see her mother again i continued it is true to assure myself that gilberte did not love me that i had known this for ever so long that i could see her again if i chose and if i did not choose forget her in course of time but these ideas like a remedy which has no effect upon certain complaints had no power whatsoever to obliterate those two parallel lines which i kept on seeing traced by gilberte and the young man as they slowly disappeared along the avenue des champselysées this was a fresh misfortune which like the rest would gradually lose its force a fresh image which would one day present itself to my minds eye completely purged of every noxious element that it now contained like those deadly poisons which one can handle without danger or like a crumb of dynamite which one can use to light ones cigarette without fear of an explosion meanwhile there was in me another force which was striving with all its might to overpower that unwholesome force which still shewed me without alteration the figure of gilberte walking in the dusk to meet and to break the shock of the renewed assaults of memory i had toiling effectively on the other side imagination the former force did indeed continue to shew me that couple walking in the champselysées and offered me other disagreeable pictures drawn from the past as for instance gilberte shrugging her shoulders when her mother asked her to stay and entertain me but the other force working upon the canvas of my hopes outlined a future far more attractively developed than this poor past which after all was so restricted for one minute in which i saw gilbertes sullen face how many were there in which i planned to my own satisfaction all the steps that she was to take towards our reconciliation perhaps even towards our betrothal it is true that this force which my imagination was concentrating upon the future it was drawing for all that from the past i was still in love with her whom it is true i believed that i detested but whenever anyone told me that i was looking well or was nicely dressed i wished that she could have been there to see me i was irritated by the desire that many people shewed about this time to ask me to their houses and refused all their invitations there was a scene at home because i did not accompany my father to an official dinner at which the bontemps were to be present with their niece albertine a young girl still hardly more than a child so it is that the different periods of our life overlap one another we scornfully decline because of one whom we love and who will some day be of so little account to see another who is of no account today with whom we shall be in love tomorrow with whom we might perhaps had we consented to see her now have fallen in love a little earlier and who would thus have put a term to our present sufferings bringing others it is true in their place mine were steadily growing less i had the surprise of discovering in my own heart one sentiment one day another the next generally inspired by some hope or some fear relative to gilberte to the gilberte whom i kept within me i ought to have reminded myself that the other the real gilberte was perhaps entirely different from mine knew nothing of the regrets that i ascribed to her was thinking probably less about me not merely than i was thinking about her but that i made her be thinking about me when i was closeted alone with my fictitious gilberte wondering what really were her feelings with regard to me and so imagining her attention as constantly directed towards myself during those periods in which our bitterness of spirit though steadily diminishing still persists a distinction must be drawn between the bitterness which comes to us from our constantly thinking of the person herself and that which is revived by certain memories some cutting speech some word in a letter that we have had from her the various forms which that bitterness can assume we shall examine when we come to deal with another and later love affair for the present it must suffice to say that of these two kinds the former is infinitely the less cruel that is because our conception of the person since it dwells always within ourselves is there adorned with the halo with which we are bound before long to invest her and bears the marks if not of the frequent solace of hope at any rate of the tranquillity of a permanent sorrow it must also be observed that the image of a person who makes us suffer counts for little if anything in those complications which aggravate the unhappiness of love prolong it and prevent our recovery just as in certain maladies the because is insignificant beyond comparison with the fever which follows it and the time that must elapse before our convalescence but if the idea of the person whom we love catches and reflects a ray of light from a mind which is on the whole optimistic it is not so with those special memories those cutting words that inimical letter i received only one that could be so described from gilberte you would say that the person herself dwelt in those fragments few and scattered as they were and dwelt there multiplied to a power of which she falls ever so far short in the idea which we are accustomed to form of her as a whole because the letter has not as the image of the beloved creature has been contemplated by us in the melancholy calm of regret we have read it devoured it in the fearful anguish with which we were wrung by an unforeseen misfortune sorrows of this sort come to us in another way from without and it is along the road of the most cruel suffering that they have penetrated to our heart the picture of our friend in our mind which we believe to be old original authentic has in reality been refashioned by her many times over the cruel memory is not itself contemporary with the restored picture it is of another age it is one of the rare witnesses to a monstrous past but inasmuch as this past continues to exist save in ourselves who have been pleased to substitute for it a miraculous age of gold a paradise in which all mankind shall be reconciled those memories those letters carry us back to reality and cannot but make us feel by the sudden pang they give us what a long way we have been borne from that reality by the baseless hopes engendered daily while we waited for something to happen not that the said reality is bound always to remain the same though that does indeed happen at times there are in our life any number of women whom we have never wished to see again and who have quite naturally responded to our in no way calculated silence with a silence as profound only in their case as we never loved them we have never counted the years spent apart from them and this instance which would invalidate our whole argument we are inclined to forget when we are considering the healing effect of isolation just as people who believe in presentiments forget all the occasions on which their own have not come true but after a time absence may prove efficacious the desire the appetite for seeing us again may after all be reborn in the heart which at present contemns us only we must allow time now the demands which we ourselves make upon time are no less exorbitant than those of a heart in process of changing for one thing time is the very thing that we are least willing to allow for our own suffering is keen and we are anxious to see it brought to an end and then too the interval of time which the other heart needs to effect its change our own heart will have spent in changing itself also so that when the goal which we had set ourselves becomes attainable it will have ceased to count as a goal or to seem worth attaining this idea however that it will be attainable that what when it no longer spells any good fortune to us we shall ultimately secure is not good fortune this idea embodies a part but a part only of the truth our good fortune accrues to us when we have grown indifferent to it but the very fact of our indifference will have made us less exacting and allow us in retrospect to feel convinced that we should have been in raptures over our good fortune had it come at a time when very probably it would have seemed to us miserably inadequate people are not very hard to satisfy nor are they very good judges of matters in which they take no interest the friendly overtures of a person whom we no longer love overtures which strike us in our indifference to her as excessive would perhaps have fallen a long way short of satisfying our love those tender speeches that invitation or acceptance we think only of the pleasure which they would have given us and not of all those other speeches and meetings by which we should have wished to see them immediately followed which we should as likely as not simply by our avidity for them have precluded from ever happening so that we can never be certain that the good fortune which comes to us too late when we are no longer in love is altogether the same as that good fortune the want of which made us at one time so unhappy there is only one person who could decide that our ego of those days he is no longer with us and were he to reappear no doubt that would be quite enough to make our good fortune whether identical or not vanish pending these posthumous fulfilments of a dream in which i should not when the time came be greatly interested by dint of my having to invent as in the days when i still hardly knew gilberte speeches letters in which she implored my forgiveness swore that she had never loved anyone but myself and besought me to marry her a series of pleasant images incessantly renewed came by degrees to hold a larger place in my mind than the vision of gilberte and the young man which had nothing now to feed upon at this point i should perhaps have resumed my visits to mme swann but for a dream that came to me in which one of my friends who was not however one that i could identify behaved with the utmost treachery towards me and appeared to believe that i had been treacherous to him abruptly awakened by the nain which this dream had given me and finding that it persisted after i was awake i turned my thoughts back to the dream racked my brains to discover who could have been the friend whom i had seen in my sleep the sound of whose name a spanish name was no longer distinct in my ears combining josephs part with pharaohs i set to work to interpret my dream i knew that when one is interpreting a dream it is often a mistake to pay too much attention to the appearance of the people one saw in it who may perhaps have been disguised or have exchanged faces like those mutilated saints on the walls of cathedrals which ignorant archaeologists have restored fitting the body of one to the head of another and confusing all their attributes and names those that people bear in a dream are apt to mislead us the person with whom we are in love is to be recognised only by the intensity of the pain that we suffer from mine i learned that though transformed while i was asleep into a young man the person whose recent betrayal still hurt me was gilberte i remembered then that the last time i had seen her on the day when her mother had forbidden her to go out to a dancinglesson she had whether in sincerity or in makebelieve declined laughing in a strange manner to believe in the genuineness of my feeling for her and by association this memory brought back to me another long before that it had been swann who would not believe in my sincerity nor that i was a suitable friend for gilberte in vain had i written to him gilberte had brought back my letter and had returned it to me with the same incomprehensible laugh she had not returned it to me at once i remembered now the whole of that scene behind the clump of laurels as soon as one is unhappy one becomes moral gilbertes recent antipathy for me seemed to me a judgment delivered on me by life for my conduct that afternoon such judgments one imagines one can escape because one looks out for carriages when one is crossing the street and avoids obvious dangers but there are others that take effect within us the accident comes from the side to which one has not been looking from inside from the heart gilbertes words if you like we might go on wrestling made me shudder i imagined her behaving like that at home perhaps in the linenroom with the young man whom i had seen escorting her along the avenue des champselysées and so just as when a little time back i had believed myself to be calmly established in a state of happiness it had been fatuous in me now that i had abandoned all thought of happiness to take for granted that at least i had grown and was going to remain calm for so long as our heart keeps enshrined with any permanence the image of another person it is not only our happiness that may at any moment be destroyed when that happiness has vanished when we have suffered and later when we have succeeded in lulling our sufferings to sleep the thing then that is as elusive as precarious as ever our happiness was is our calm mine returned to me in the end for the cloud which lowering our resistance tempering our desires has penetrated in the train of a dream the enclosure of our mind is bound in course of time to dissolve permanence and stability being assured to nothing in this world not even to grief besides those whose suffering is due to love are as we say of certain invalids their own physicians as consolation can come to them only from the person who is the because of their grief and as their grief is an emanation from that person it is there in their grief itself that they must in the end find a remedy which it will disclose to them at a given moment for as long as they turn it over in their minds this grief will continue to shew them fresh aspects of the loved the regretted creature at one moment so intensely hateful that one has no longer the slightest desire to see her since before finding enjoyment in her company one would have first to make her suffer at another so pleasant that the pleasantness in which one has invested her one adds to her own stock of good qualities and finds in it a fresh reason for hope but even although the anguish that had reawakened in me did at length grow calm i no longer wished except just occasionally to visit mme swann in the first place because among those who love and have been forsaken the state of incessant even if unconfessed expectancy in which they live undergoes a spontaneous transformation and while to all appearance unchanged substitutes for its original elements others that are precisely the opposite the first were the consequences of a reaction from the painful incidents which had upset us the tension of waiting for what is yet to come is mingled with fear all the more since we desire at such moments should no message come to us from her whom we love to act for ourselves and are none too confident of the success of a step which once we have taken it we may find it impossible to follow up but presently without our having noticed any change this tension which still endures is sustained we discover no longer by our recollection of the past but by anticipation of an imaginary future from that moment it is almost pleasant besides the first state by continuing for some time has accustomed us to living in expectation the suffering that we felt during those last meetings survives in us still but is already lulled to sleep we are in no haste to arouse it especially as we do not see very clearly what to ask for now the possession of a little more of the woman whom we love would only make more essential to us the part that we did not yet possess which is bound to remain whatever happens since our requirements are begotten of our satisfactions an irreducible quantity another final reason came later on to reinforce this and to make me discontinue altogether my visits to mme swann this reason slow in revealing itself was not that i had now forgotten gilberte but that i must make every effort to forget her as speedily as possible no doubt now that the keen edge of my suffering was dulled my visits to mme swann had become once again for what sorrow remained in me the sedative and distraction which had been so precious to me at first but what made the sedative efficacious made the distraction impossible namely that with these visits the memory of gilberte was intimately blended the distraction would be of no avail to me unless it was employed to combat a sentiment which the presence of gilberte no longer nourished thoughts interests passions in which gilberte should have no part these states of consciousness to which the person whom we love remains a stranger then occupy a place which however small it may be at first is always so much reconquered from the love that has been in unchallenged possession of our whole soul we must seek to encourage these thoughts to make them grow while the sentiment which is no more now than a memory dwindles so that the new elements introduced into our mind contest with that sentiment wrest from it an ever increasing part of our soul until at last the victory is complete i decided that this was the only way in which my love could be killed and i was still young enough still courageous enough to undertake the attempt to subject myself to that most cruel grief which springs from the certainty that whatever time one may devote to the effort it will prove successful in the end the reason i now gave in my letters to gilberte for refusing to see her was an allusion to some mysterious misunderstanding wholly fictitious which was supposed to have arisen between her and myself and as to which i had hoped at first that gilberte would insist upon my furnishing her with an explanation but as a matter of fact never even in the most insignificant relations in life does a request for enlightenment come from a correspondent who knows that an obscure untruthful incriminating sentence has been written on purpose so that he shall protest against it and is only too glad to feel when he reads it that he possesses and to keep in his own hands the initiative in the coming operations for all the more reason is this so in our more tender relations in which love is endowed with so much eloquence indifference with so little curiosity gilberte having never appeared to doubt nor sought to learn more about this misunderstanding it became for me a real entity to which i referred anew in every letter and there is in these baseless situations in the affectation of coldness a sort of fascination which tempts one to persevere in them by dint of writing now that our hearts are sundered so that gilberte might answer but they are not do explain what you mean i had gradually come to believe that they were by constantly repeating life may have changed for us it will never destroy the feeling that we had for one another in the hope of hearing myself one day say but there has been no change the feeling is stronger now than ever it was i was living with the idea that life had indeed changed that we should keep only the memory of a feeling which no longer existed as certain neurotics from having at first pretended to be ill end by becoming chronic invalids now whenever i had to write to gilberte i brought my mind back to this imagined change which being now tacitly admitted by the silence which she preserved with regard to it in her replies would in future subsist between us then gilberte ceased to make a point of ignoring it she too adopted my point of view and as in the speeches at official banquets when the foreign sovereign who is being entertained adopts practically the same expressions as have just been used by the sovereign who is entertaining him whenever i wrote to gilberte life may have parted us the memory of the days when we knew one another will endure she never failed to respond life may have parted us it cannot make us forget those happy hours which will always be dear to us both though we should have found it hard to say why or how lifehad parted us or what change had occurred my sufferings were no longer excessive and yet one day when i was telling her in a letter that i had heard of the death of our old barleysugar woman in the champselysées as i wrote the words i felt at once that this would distress you in me it awakened a host of memories i could not restrain myself from bursting into tears when i saw that i was speaking in the past tense as though it were of some dead friend now almost forgotten of this love of which in spite of myself i had never ceased to think as of a thing still alive or one that at least might be born again nothing can be more affectionate than this sort of correspondence between friends who do not wish to see one another any more gilbertes letters to me had all the delicate refinement of those which i used to write to people who did not matter and shewed me the same apparent marks of affection which it was so pleasant for me to receive from her but as time went on every refusal to see her disturbed me less and as she became less dear to me my painful memories were no longer strong enough to destroy by their incessant return the growing pleasure which i found in thinking of florence or of venice i regretted at such moments that i had abandoned the idea of diplomacy and had condemned myself to a sedentary existence in order not to be separated from a girl whom i should not see again and had already almost forgotten we construct our house of life to suit another person and when at length it is ready to receive her that person does not come presently she is dead to us and we live on a prisoner within the walls which were intended only for her if venice seemed to my parents to be a long way off and its climate treacherous it was at least quite easy for me to gov without tiring myself and settle down at balbec but to do that i should have had to leave paris to forego those visits thanks to which infrequent as they were i might sometimes hear mme swann telling me about her daughter besides i was beginning to find in them various pleasures in which gilberte had no part when spring drew round and with it the cold weather during an icy lent and the hailstorms of holy week as mme swann began to find it cold in the house i used often to see her entertaining her guests in her furs her shivering hands and shoulders hidden beneath the gleaming white carpet of an immense rectangular muff and a cape both of ermine which she had not taken off on coming in from her drive and which suggested the last patches of the snows of winter more persistent than the rest which neither the heat of the fire nor the advancing season had succeeded in melting and the whole truth about these glacial but already flowering weeks was suggested to me in this drawingroom which soon i should be entering no more by other more intoxicating forms of whiteness that for example of the guelderroses clustering at the summits of their tall bare stalks like the rectilinear trees in preraphaelite paintings their balls of blossom divided yet composite white as annunciating angels and breathing a fragrance as of lemons for the mistress of tansonville knew that april even an icebound april was not barren of flowers that winter spring summer are not held apart by barriers as hermetic as might be supposed by the towndweller who until the first hot day imagines the world as containing nothing but houses that stand naked in the rain that mme swann was content with the consignments furnished by her combray gardener that she did not by the intervention of her own special florist fill up the gaps left by an insufficiently powerful magic with subsidies borrowed from a precocious mediterranean shore i do not for a moment suggest nor did it worry me at the time it was enough to fill me with longing for country scenes that overhanging the loose snowdrifts of the muff in which mme swann kept her hands the guelderrose snowballs which served very possibly in the mind of my hostess no other purpose than to compose on the advice of bergotte a symphony in white with her furniture and her garments reminded me that what the good friday music in parsifal symbolised was a natural miracle which one could see performed every year if one had the sense to look for it and assisted by the acid and heady perfume of the other kinds of blossom which although their names were unknown to me had brought me so often to a standstill to gaze at them on my walks round combray made mme swanns drawingroom as virginal as candidly in bloom without the least vestige of greenery as overladen with genuine scents of flowers as was the little lane by tansonville but it was still more than i could endure that these memories should be recalled to me there was a risk of their reviving what little remained of my love for gilberte besides albeit i no longer felt the least distress during these visits to mme swann i extended the intervals between them and endeavoured to see as little of her as possible at most since i continued not to go out of paris i allowed myself an occasional walk with her fine weather had come at last and the sun was hot as i knew that before luncheon mme swann used to go out every day for an hour and would stroll for a little in the avenue du bois near the etoile a spot which at that time because of the people who used to collect there to gaze at the swells whom they knew only by name was known as the shabbygenteel club i persuaded my parents on sundays for on weekdays i was busy all morning to let me postpone my luncheon until long after theirs until a quarter past one and go for a walk before it during may that year i never missed a sunday for gilberte had gone to stay with friends in the country i used to reach the arc de triomphe about noon i kept watch at the entrance to the avenue never taking my eyes off the corner of the sidestreet along which mme swann who had only a few yards to walk would come from her house as by this time many of the people who had been strolling there were going home to luncheon those who remained were few in number and for the most part fashionably dressed suddenly on the gravelled path unhurrying cool luxuriant mme swann appeared displaying around her a toilet which was never twice the same but which i remember as being typically mauve then she hoisted and unfurled at the end of its long stalk just at the moment when her radiance was most complete the silken banner of a wide parasol of a shade that matched the showering petals of her gown a whole troop of people escorted her swann himself four or five fellows from the club who had been to call upon her that morning or whom she had met in the street and their black or grey agglomeration obedient to her every gesture performing the almost mechanical movements of a lifeless setting in which odette was framed gave to this woman in whose eyes alone was there any intensity the air of looking out in front of her from among all those men as from a window behind which she had taken her stand and made her emerge there frail but fearless in the nudity of her delicate colours like the apparition of a creature of a different species of an unknown race and of almost martial strength by virtue of which she seemed by herself a match for all her multiple escort smiling rejoicing in the fine weather in the sunshine which had not yet become trying with the air of calm assurance of a creator who has accomplished his task and takes no thought for anything besides certain that her clothes even though the vulgar herd should fail to appreciate them were the smartest anywhere to be seen she wore them for herself and for her friends naturally without exaggerated attention to them but also without absolute detachment not preventing the little bows of ribbon upon her bodice and skirt from floating buoyantly upon the air before her like separate creatures of whose presence there she was not unconscious but was indulgent enough to let them play if they chose keeping their own rhythm provided that they accompanied her where she led the way and even upon her mauve parasol which as often as not she had not yet put up when she appeared on the scene she let fall now and then as though upon a bunch of parma violets a gaze happy and so kindly that when it was fastened no longer upon her friends but on some inanimate object her eyes still seemed to smile she thus kept open she made her garments occupy that interval of smartness of which the men with whom she was on the most familiar terms respected both the existence and its necessity not without shewing a certain deference as of profane visitors to a shrine an admission of their own ignorance an interval over which they recognised that their friend had as we recognise that a sick man has over the special precautions that he has to take or a mother over her childrens education a competent jurisdiction no less than by the court which encircled her and seemed not to observe the passersby mme swann by the lateness of her appearance there at once suggested those rooms in which she had spent so long so leisurely a morning and to which she must presently return for luncheon she seemed to indicate their proximity by the unhurrying ease of her progress like the turn that one takes up and down ones own garden of those rooms one would have said that she was carrying about her still the cool the indoor shade but for that very reason the sight of her gave me only a stronger sensation of open air and warmth all the more because being assured in my own mind that in accordance with the liturgy with the ritual in which mme swann was so profoundly d her clothes were connected with the time of year and of day by a bond both inevitable and unique i felt that the flowers upon the stiff straw brim of her hat the babyribbons upon her dress had been even more naturally born of the month of may than the flowers in gardens and in woods and to learn what latest change there was in weather or season i had not to raise my eyes higher than to her parasol open and outstretched like another a nearer sky round clement mobile blue for these rites if they were of sovereign importance subjugated their glory and consequently mme swann her own in condescending obedience to the day the spring the sun none of which struck me as being sufficiently flattered that so elegant a woman had been graciously pleased not to ignore their existence and had chosen on their account a gown of a brighter of a thinner fabric suggesting to me by the opening of its collar and sleeves the moist warmness of the throat and wrists that they exposed in a word had taken for them all the pains that a great personage takes who having gaily condescended to pay a visit to common folk in the country whom everyone even the most plebeian knows yet makes a point of donning for the occasion suitable attire on her arrival i would greet mme swann she stop me and say in english good morning and smile we would walk a little way together and i learned then that these canons according to which she dressed it was for her own satisfaction that she obeyed them as though yielding to a superior wisdom of which she herself was high priestess for if it should happen that feeling too warm she threw open or even took off altogether and gave me to carry the jacket which she had intended to keep buttoned up i would discover in the blouse beneath it a thousand details of execution which had had every chance of remaining there unperceived like those parts of an orchestral score to which the composer has devoted infinite labour albeit they may never reach the ears of the public or in the sleeves of the jacket that lay folded across my arm i would see i would drink in slowly for my own pleasure or from affection for its wearer some exquisite detail a deliciously tinted strip a lining of mauve satinette which ordinarily concealed from every eye was yet just as delicately fashioned as the outer parts like those gothic carvings on a cathedral hidden on the inside of a balustrade eighty feet from the ground as perfect as are the basreliefs over the main porch and yet never seen by any living man until happening to pass that way upon his travels an artist obtains leave to climb up there among them to stroll in the open air sweeping the whole town with a comprehensive gaze between the soaring towers what enhanced this impression that mme swann was walking in the avenue as though along the paths of her own garden was for people ignorant of her habit of taking exercise that she had come there on foot without any carriage following she whom once may had begun they were accustomed to see behind the most brilliant turnout the smartest liveries in paris gently and majestically seated like a goddess in the balmy air of an immense victoria on eight springs on foot mme swann had the appearance especially as her pace began to slacken in the heat of the sun of having yielded to curiosity of committing an exclusive breach of all the rules of her code like those crowned heads who without consulting anyone accompanied by the slightly scandalised admiration of a suite which dares not venture any criticism step out of their boxes during a gala performance and visit the lobby of the theatre mingling for a moment or two with the rest of the audience so between mme swann and themselves the crowd felt that there existed those barriers of a certain kind of opulence which seem to them the most insurmountable that there are the faubourg saintgermain may have its barriers also but these are less telling to the eyes and imagination of the shabbygenteel these latter when in the presence of a real personage more simple more easily mistaken for the wife of a small professional or business man less remote from the people will not feel the same sense of their own inequality almost of their unworthiness as dismays them when they encounter mme swann of course women of that sort are not themselves dazzled as the crowd are by the brilliance of their apparel they have ceased to pay any attention to it but only because they have grown used to it that is to say have come to look upon it more and more as natural and necessary to judge their fellow creatures according as they are more or less initiated into these luxurious ways so that the grandeur which they allow themselves to display or discover in others being wholly material easily verified slowly acquired the lack of it hard to compensate if such women place a passerby in the lowest rank of society it is by the same instinctive process that has made them appear to him as in the highest that is to say instinctively at first sight and without possibility of appeal perhaps that special class of society which included in those days women like lady israels who mixed with the women of the aristocracy and mme swann who was to get to know them later on that intermediate class inferior to the faubourg saintgermain since it ran after the denizens of that quarter but superior to everything that was not of the faubourg saintgermain possessing this peculiarity that while already detached from the world of the merely rich it was riches still that it represented but riches that had been canalised serving a purpose swayed by an idea that was artistic malleable gold chased with a poetic design taught to smile perhaps that class in the same form at least and with the same charm exists no longer in any event the women who were its members would not satisfy today what was the primary condition on which they reigned since with advancing age they have lost almost all of them their beauty whereas it was just as much as from the pinnacle of her noble fortune from the glorious zenith of her ripe and still so fragrant summer that mme swann majestic smiling kind as she advanced along the avenue du bois saw like hypatia beneath the slow tread of her feet worlds revolving various young men as they passed looked at her anxiously not knowing whether their vague acquaintance with her especially since having been introduced only once at the most to swann they were afraid that he might not remember them was sufficient excuse for their venturing to take off their hats and they trembled to think of the consequences as they made up their minds asking themselves whether the gesture so bold so sacrilegious a tempting of providence would not let loose the catastrophic forces of nature or bring down upon them the vengeance of a jealous god it provoked only like the winding of a piece of clockwork a series of gesticulations from little responsive bowing figures who were none other than odettes escort beginning with swann himself who raised his tall hat lined in green leather with an exquisite courtesy which he had acquired in the faubourg saintgermain but to which was no longer wedded the indifference that he would at one time have shewn its place was now taken as though he had been to some extent permeated by odettes prejudices at once by irritation at having to acknowledge the salute of a person who was none too well dressed and by satisfaction at his wifes knowing so many people a mixed sensation to which he gave expression by saying to the smart friends who walked by his side whatl another upon my word i cannot imagine where my wife picks all these fellows up meanwhile having greeted with a slight movement of her head the terrified youth who had already passed out of sight though his heart was still beating furiously mme swann turned to me then it is all over she put it to me you are not ever coming to see gilberte again i am glad you make an exception of me and are not going to drop me straight away i like seeing you but i used to like also the influence you had over my daughter i am sure she is very sorry about it too however i must not bully you or you will make up your mind at once that you never want to set eyes on me again odette sagans trying to speak to you swann called his wifes attention and there indeed was the prince as in some transformation scene at the close of a play or in a circus or an old painting wheeling his horse round so as to face her in a magnificent heroic pose and doffing his hat with a sweeping theatrical and so to speak allegorical flourish in which he displayed all the chivalrous courtesy of a great noble bowing in token of his respect for woman were she incarnate in a woman whom it was impossible for his mother or his sister to know and at every moment recognised in the depths of the liquid transparency and of the luminous glaze of the shadow which her parasol cast over her mme swann was receiving the salutations of the last belated horsemen who passed as though in a cinematograph taken as they galloped in the blinding glare of the avenue men from the clubs the names of whom which meant only celebrities to the public antoine de castellane adalbert de montmorency and the rest were for mme swann the familiar names of friends and as the average span of life the relative longevity of our memories of poetical sensations is much greater than that of our memories of what the heart has suffered long after the sorrows that i once felt on gilbertes account have faded and vanished there has survived them the pleasure that i still derive whenever i close my eyes and read as it were upon the face of a sundial the minutes that are recorded between a quarter past twelve and one of the clock in the month of may from seeing myself once again strolling and talking thus with mme swann beneath her parasol as though in the coloured shade of a wistaria bowerembed

alternative,in due timein the creative minds of capcom and shinji mikami assembled on a project that would change the face of horror gaming eloquently known as resident evil for it is time though it did not coin the term survival horror with it is predecessors such as alone in the dark and possibly sweet home being the first for which resident evil is actually the spiritual successor of it was one of the first in d capability that was able to get most if not all of it is aspects right even by todays standards the classic titan still manages to incite fear among the masses of audiences it is available to time would pass as well as the sequel to resident evil before in another franchise would establish it is own brand of horror albeit with a more psychological effect established through ambiance environment and a towns history that pulled the player in with it is share of cutscenes articles to detail it is history and often relatable characters that were no more than everyday people this was the dawn of silent hill and it was glorious the franchise made a living not just off of monster design but effective use of such as well as the constant feeling of claustrophobia and narrative the birth of it is iconic figure pyramid head living as symbolism specifically designated for silent hill as a gesture towards judgementfirst nail in the coffinit should be noted that during it is entire construction the first games rendered as classics between the franchise and horror gaming in general were all constructed by team silent all brought in by various konami directors of which mostly remained constant except for the primary directors themselves though still keeping otheraspects the same such as the writing production and soundtrack the first escalated change in the series was the introduction of silent hill abandoning the city itself in change for the only person in correlation with it the antagonist walter sullivannow this major change came as a surprise to most in abandoning the town it is loved most in order for a relative even causing most people to speculate around the internet that the entry in the series was originally supposed to be the spawn of an entirely new franchise realistically this more correlated to the start of a trend that would because the fall of more easternorientated franchises which was attempting to market to western audiences silent hill along with games like resident evil outbreak code veronica and resident evil attempted to reach wider audiences by evolving with more actionorientated gameplay now this is not to take credit away from those games with each being good in their own sense or right but it makes the reformation in silent hills franchise make a lot more sensesecond nail in the coffinafter once silent hill had caught enough attention resident evil executed the perfect example of how to splice genres and come out successful in the end with critical acclaim something team silent was unfortunately unable to do which led to their forced disbandment by konami so in order to try and replicate their success konami began to pitch the franchise off to more western developers starting off with silent hill homecoming assembled by double helix games in third nail in the coffinthis is what metaphorically and quite literally killed the order silent hill homecoming if anything served as a rehash of past deeds from the past games featuring pyramid head for absolutely no reason faulty plot points with an expected twist and overall botch job on how to hand your franchise over to a random western develop team as their first video game on recorddespite this konami continued to try and find that blend of action gore and shock value that kept more western franchises held together like fear dead space and left dead only leading to more decent at best releases from studios with better thoughts in concepts rather than executions finally leading up to silent hill downpour in once more developed by an inexperienced studiofinal nail in the coffinby this point it is hard to see it get worse right but even through a simple job of remastering the graphics of two already made video games konami managed to hand the series off to one more underdeveloped company that would make unneeded changes and because the downfall of one of the simplest jobs in the games existencethis resulted in even getting the negative attention of one of the originating members of team silent and the creator of pyramid head himself along with any and all monsters between the first games masahiro ito when asked his opinion on a pair of screenshots comparing the original product to the remaster via twitterand the one thing ito had to saynow my piecekonami is not necessarily known to care much for it is ips with the exception of kojima productions and everything metal gear if it literally was not for kojima konami would have bankrupted awhile ago or at least had to actually focus on creating games with some integrity i mean you can even look at the longerstanding castlevania i mean lord of shadows practically steals elements from shadow of the colossus god of war and dantes inferno and that is before i even watched the zero punctuation review once more the problem with that was immediately trying to modernize something that is been old for the last years which is damn near years gamer time in order to aim for some sort of new audience which did not work even with kojimas helpi mean i do get some of the problems that works in cooperation with horror because really it is a market that takes some damn finesse in and you probably will not get the biggest return immediately due to not covering as accessible an experience as most actionadventure games but once you have indie developers making better games than some of the biggest blockbusters and teams available can even think about and still making money sigh guys like shinji mikami the original director of the resident evil games as well as other creative works like viewtiful joe god hand vanquish and otherwise have lasted in this industry and thrived off creativity regardless of how many sales whatever project could pull and it is served him well keiichiro toyama as the original director for silent hill managed to thrive off of the siren series without sacrificing anything i am just waiting for the day konami and capcom for that matter can see that it was the original psychological effect of these horror games including fatal frame that kept is up at night not some bullshit they learned off of texas chainsaw massacre or the latest robb zombie moviein consolationthough this information is only covering late it does give me some hope for the future as well as shinji directing another horror game for the first time in almost years i believe it is taken long enough for these developers to realize action sells but playing on the human mind is why we got into this it is what quickens our heart rates because our thoughts to go into a state irrationality makes us run away from the monsters with only bullets left and even in a state where everything seems calm helps us remain in a state of fear and constant paranoia and in that way personally helps me feel alive in a sense and i would not have it any other wayall hail the orderupdate as of gamescomguillermo del toro and hideo kojima
