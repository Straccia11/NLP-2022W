rock,in due timein the creative minds of capcom and shinji mikami assembled on a project that would change the face of horror gaming eloquently known as resident evil for it is time though it did not coin the term survival horror with it is predecessors such as alone in the dark and possibly sweet home being the first for which resident evil is actually the spiritual successor of it was one of the first in d capability that was able to get most if not all of it is aspects right even by todays standards the classic titan still manages to incite fear among the masses of audiences it is available to time would pass as well as the sequel to resident evil before in another franchise would establish it is own brand of horror albeit with a more psychological effect established through ambiance environment and a towns history that pulled the player in with it is share of cutscenes articles to detail it is history and often relatable characters that were no more than everyday people this was the dawn of silent hill and it was glorious the franchise made a living not just off of monster design but effective use of such as well as the constant feeling of claustrophobia and narrative the birth of it is iconic figure pyramid head living as symbolism specifically designated for silent hill as a gesture towards judgementfirst nail in the coffinit should be noted that during it is entire construction the first games rendered as classics between the franchise and horror gaming in general were all constructed by team silent all brought in by various konami directors of which mostly remained constant except for the primary directors themselves though still keeping otheraspects the same such as the writing production and soundtrack the first escalated change in the series was the introduction of silent hill abandoning the city itself in change for the only person in correlation with it the antagonist walter sullivannow this major change came as a surprise to most in abandoning the town it is loved most in order for a relative even causing most people to speculate around the internet that the entry in the series was originally supposed to be the spawn of an entirely new franchise realistically this more correlated to the start of a trend that would because the fall of more easternorientated franchises which was attempting to market to western audiences silent hill along with games like resident evil outbreak code veronica and resident evil attempted to reach wider audiences by evolving with more actionorientated gameplay now this is not to take credit away from those games with each being good in their own sense or right but it makes the reformation in silent hills franchise make a lot more sensesecond nail in the coffinafter once silent hill had caught enough attention resident evil executed the perfect example of how to splice genres and come out successful in the end with critical acclaim something team silent was unfortunately unable to do which led to their forced disbandment by konami so in order to try and replicate their success konami began to pitch the franchise off to more western developers starting off with silent hill homecoming assembled by double helix games in third nail in the coffinthis is what metaphorically and quite literally killed the order silent hill homecoming if anything served as a rehash of past deeds from the past games featuring pyramid head for absolutely no reason faulty plot points with an expected twist and overall botch job on how to hand your franchise over to a random western develop team as their first video game on recorddespite this konami continued to try and find that blend of action gore and shock value that kept more western franchises held together like fear dead space and left dead only leading to more decent at best releases from studios with better thoughts in concepts rather than executions finally leading up to silent hill downpour in once more developed by an inexperienced studiofinal nail in the coffinby this point it is hard to see it get worse right but even through a simple job of remastering the graphics of two already made video games konami managed to hand the series off to one more underdeveloped company that would make unneeded changes and because the downfall of one of the simplest jobs in the games existencethis resulted in even getting the negative attention of one of the originating members of team silent and the creator of pyramid head himself along with any and all monsters between the first games masahiro ito when asked his opinion on a pair of screenshots comparing the original product to the remaster via twitterand the one thing ito had to saynow my piecekonami is not necessarily known to care much for it is ips with the exception of kojima productions and everything metal gear if it literally was not for kojima konami would have bankrupted awhile ago or at least had to actually focus on creating games with some integrity i mean you can even look at the longerstanding castlevania i mean lord of shadows practically steals elements from shadow of the colossus god of war and dantes inferno and that is before i even watched the zero punctuation review once more the problem with that was immediately trying to modernize something that is been old for the last years which is damn near years gamer time in order to aim for some sort of new audience which did not work even with kojimas helpi mean i do get some of the problems that works in cooperation with horror because really it is a market that takes some damn finesse in and you probably will not get the biggest return immediately due to not covering as accessible an experience as most actionadventure games but once you have indie developers making better games than some of the biggest blockbusters and teams available can even think about and still making money sigh guys like shinji mikami the original director of the resident evil games as well as other creative works like viewtiful joe god hand vanquish and otherwise have lasted in this industry and thrived off creativity regardless of how many sales whatever project could pull and it is served him well keiichiro toyama as the original director for silent hill managed to thrive off of the siren series without sacrificing anything i am just waiting for the day konami and capcom for that matter can see that it was the original psychological effect of these horror games including fatal frame that kept is up at night not some bullshit they learned off of texas chainsaw massacre or the latest robb zombie moviein consolationthough this information is only covering late it does give me some hope for the future as well as shinji directing another horror game for the first time in almost years i believe it is taken long enough for these developers to realize action sells but playing on the human mind is why we got into this it is what quickens our heart rates because our thoughts to go into a state irrationality makes us run away from the monsters with only bullets left and even in a state where everything seems calm helps us remain in a state of fear and constant paranoia and in that way personally helps me feel alive in a sense and i would not have it any other wayall hail the orderupdate as of gamescomguillermo del toro and hideo kojima working on silent hills starring norman reedusupdate as of kojimas firing silent hills cancellationfuckkonamiembed
